    <p>Just completed a nine day retreat here at Jhana Grove, down the road from my old home at Bodhinyana Monastery. The retreat was wonderful, it was so nice to see such sincerity and dedication. We all went on a journey, and afterwards nothing is quite the same. </p>
<p>The BSWA is wonderful as ever, such a lovely community. They are able to offer this amazing center for retreats by donation only. The food for 60 retreatants is brought every day by supporters. Quite astonishing, really. The organization has been both professional and kind, and I have nothing but praise for all those who helped make it possible.</p>
<p><em>Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu!</em></p>
<p>On a more practical note, I see the number of comments on ‘Secular Buddhism’ has continued to climb. I haven’t had the chance to read all 350+ yet (!) But clearly it is a topic demanding greater attention. I will return to it, trying to break down issues into more manageable chunks. If you have raised questions for me that you would still like to see answered, please don’t feel shy to repost your comments in future threads. </p>
