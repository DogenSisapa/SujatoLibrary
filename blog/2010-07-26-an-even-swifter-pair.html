    <p>Dear and beloved bloggists,</p>
<p>There’s been some discussion here on samatha/vipassana, sparked in part by my post on <em>A Swift Pair of Messengers</em> a few days ago. This is, of course, one of the old Theravadin family arguments. I’d like to congratulate the posters so far on their civil and engaging responses.</p>
<p>The spark behind writing SPM was simply this: that I had grown bored and frustrated with partial and inadequate ways of approaching this problem, which really is central to how we practice the Dhamma. Everything I had read, every conversation i had been involved in, had relied on one or two isolated passages, or on the discredited commentarial system of interpretation. </p>
<p>In writing SPM I thought that there was a better way. No, we cannot hope to solve every problem; but we can at least improve the quality of dialogue. </p>
<p>Since that time, every criticism of my findings that I have seen has been based on two things.</p>
<p>1. Completely ignore every argument and piece of evidence that I have so painstakingly assembled.<br/>
2. Invoke some obscure, irrelevant, or dubious passage from the suttas, a half-remembered quote, or an opinion from some teacher or other.</p>
<p>As we can all see from the response on this blog, this is still exactly what is happening. </p>
<p>This is not good enough. It is simply not adequate to lay out the spiritual path for Nibbana on such half-baked premises. This stuff matters, folks. Get real.</p>
<p>So, in the interests of getting realer, let me suggest some guidelines for debate.</p>
<p>1. Read <em>A Swift Pair of Messengers</em>.<br/>
2. Engage with and debate the contents and arguments that I have put forth there. </p>
<p>Disagree by all means. But do your homework – I did. When I say something like, ‘There is no path of dry insight in the suttas’, this is not because I am relying on some vague memory of something i might have heard sometime. It’s because, ten years ago, when I was researching this book, i systematically searched through every page of the Pali canon for passages dealing with samatha and vipassana. I believe I have identified every significant passage. Of course, I may well have missed something, and may well have misinterpreted some things. Fine, if that is so, point it out. But don’t just ignore the work that has been done. </p>
<p>Let’s have a debate – an informed, reasonable debate. Perhaps, then, we might get somewhere, rather than just rehashing the same old same old.</p>
