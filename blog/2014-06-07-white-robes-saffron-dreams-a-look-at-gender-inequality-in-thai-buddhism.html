    <p>Thanks to Ayya Adhimutta for sending me the link for <a href="http://www.chiangmaicitynews.com/news.php?id=3984" target="_blank">this article</a>. It’s about a new documentary looking at the discrimination that nuns suffer in Thai Buddhism. The article itself is interesting; and the film is available by order from the director (email in the article). </p>
<p>We’ve previously seen the docu <a href="http://www.bhikkhunidocumentary.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Buddha’s Forgotten Nuns</em></a> by young Australian director Wiriya Sati. It’s great to see mo </p>
