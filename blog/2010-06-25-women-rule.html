    <p>Who exactly is in charge? I live in NSW, Australia, near Sydney, and chief public leaders are:</p>
<p>Sydney mayor: Clover Moore<br/>
NSW Governor: Marie Bashir<br/>
NSW Premier: Kristina Keneally<br/>
Governor-General: Ms Quentin Bryce<br/>
Prime Minster: Julia Gillard<br/>
Head of State: Queen Elizabeth II</p>
<p>Quite extraordinary; but a misleading snapshot of public life in Australia, where the majority of positions are still held by men, and ethnic minorities are badly under-represented.</p>
