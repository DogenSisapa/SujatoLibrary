    <p>Dear blog-friends, my apologies for abandoning you for the past several weeks, or is it months now? I have, as you may have suspected, been occupied with other things, primarily with doing work for SuttaCentral.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for my focus on SuttaCentral is that I am planning on taking an extended break in order to translate Pali suttas.</p>
<p>Since it’s mainly concerning SuttaCentral, I’ve put the main post on our Discourse forum, where you can read all about it and voice your comments:</p>
