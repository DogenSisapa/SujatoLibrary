    <p>The last couple of days I’ve received a whole bunch of emails announcing a breakthrough in dating the Buddha. An international team of archeologists has dug beneath the previously excavated remains at the Buddha’s birth place, Lumbini, where they found the remnants of a wooden structure, which was dated to the 6th century BCE. Breathless reports in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/science/new-clues-may-change-buddhas-date-of-birth.html?_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a> and elsewhere said that this is the first time we can fix a concrete date to the Buddha’s life.</p>
<p>Okay, so great, new findings are always welcome But what did they find, exactly? I haven’t had the chance to read the peer-reviewed article yet. But the topic was posted on the academic discussion forum H-Buddhism, where <a href="http://hum.leiden.edu/lias/staff/silk.html" target="_blank">Jonathon Silk</a>  had <a href="http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=H-Buddhism&amp;month=1311&amp;week=d&amp;msg=xHndwRwtqBE6/4xsiJeE6Q&amp;user=&amp;pw=" target="_blank">the following to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>what has been found is wood beneath the Asokan layer. There is *no* indication that the wood is connected with the Buddha in any way shape or form. … And in fact, except for a single–I would say incautious–sentence, the article basically says this… the traditional spot rebuilt by Asoka had earlier a wooden structure upon it. What that structure may have been, and whether it could conceivably have had any connection with the Buddha–no evidence at all!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry about that. Truth can be dull, can’t it? The fuss did raise the <a href="http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=H-Buddhism&amp;month=1311&amp;week=d&amp;msg=24xEk9YNLPKS18VArkPhLw&amp;user=&amp;pw=" target="_blank">following interesting response</a> from Achim Bayer. It discusses the prestige in which archeology seems to be regarded, which avid readers will recognize is an issue I have whinged about before. Good to see this is being addressed directly.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another of the issues involved is that archeology, dealing with material things, seems to be considered “science”, while the study of history as a whole is just “humanities” (at least in the anglophone world) and thus less reliable.</p>
<p>These were my experiences when dealing with the “Lama Wearing Trousers” last year.</p>

<p>I have now organized a panel by the title “Authenticity, Uncertainty, and Deceit in Buddhist Art and Archaeology” at the IABS 2014 in Vienna – to which everyone interested in such methodological questions is warmly invited.</p></blockquote>
