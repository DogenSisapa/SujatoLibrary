    <p>Sometimes we just don’t notice the best parts of our own country.</p>
<p>Last night we were in a camp ground next to the Mississippi in Baton Rouge. I sat by the slow, majestic river at sunset, watching the lightning play in the clouds. There was a raucous swarm of hundreds of little black birds. The place was a horse place; and huge RVs were gathering for the big football game on the weekend.</p>
<p>We were approached by a cop in the campgrounds.</p>
<p>“Some folks said you looked like you was lost.”</p>
<p>“Well, we were – we couldn’t find the office!”</p>
<p>I don’t know if someone thought we were terrorists. Whatever. Once the possible terrorist threat was resolved, we got to chatting in the amiable way of folks round here.</p>
<p>“Where y’all from?”</p>
<p>“Australia.” …</p>
<p>When he found out we were headed across America, he asked if we’re going to the mountains.</p>
<p>“They’re real beautiful. ‘Course I’ve never been there myself…”</p>
<p>Next morning we’re in the outer light-industrial wastelands of Baton Rouge. Our mission: oil change. In the RV shop, I said “Hi” to the shopgirl.</p>
<p>“Where y’all from?” she said.</p>
<p>“Australia” (and incidentally, when I rang this same shop yesterday, the one who answered it picked me as Australian just from my accent. Kudos!)</p>
<p>“Oh, I just love Australia,” she said. “I really want to visit the Cathedral – It’s so beautiful, doncha think!”</p>
<p>“Umm… Which cathedral would that be?” I said. “There’s a few.”</p>
<p>“Why, Hillsong! Doncha know it?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “But I’ve never been there myself…”</p>
