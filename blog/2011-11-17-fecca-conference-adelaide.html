    <p>I’m at the FECCA conference on Advancing Multiculturalism in Adelaide, as part of the interfaith Australian Partnership of Religious Organizations roundtable. I’ll try to blog some bits I find<br/>
interesting. These are purely random observations, not an attempt to cover everything.</p>
<p>Paraphrases in normal text, “quotes in quote marks”, (my own observations in brackets).</p>
<p>PANEL ON DISABILITY</p>
<p>(Two very moving and insightful presentations from persons with disabilities. Sorry, these few remarks can’t capture the strength of these inspiring people… But anyway, here’s a few bits and pieces) Hon Kelly Vincent (Dignity for Disability party):</p>
<p>“You can’t access justice if you can’t access the building.”</p>
<p>Christian Astourian (FECCA disability committee chair)</p>
<p>There are a million people with disabilities in Australia who come from a non-English speaking background; they take up services and support for disabilities only half as much as those from an<br/>
English-speaking background. Services are supplied largely in English, and non-English speakers feel marginalized and excluded.</p>
<p>“I strongly believe that in this world we are all connected in one way or another.”</p>
<p>Rather than looking at people with disabilities as liability, we should look at the contribution to society.</p>
<p>Advice for parents: Don’t hold back from and be overprotective. Empower children with disabilities, the disability is only one part of them.</p>
<p>“I really believe that in this life we should do the best with what we’ve got.”</p>
