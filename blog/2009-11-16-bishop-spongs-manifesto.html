    <p>I’ve been a fan of John Shelby Spong for a long time. I can still remember the book my mum sent me when I was in Thailand, <em>A New Christianity for a New World: Why Traditional Faith Is Dying and How a New Faith Is Being Born</em>. When i offered it for the library at Wat Nanachat, I remember feeling hurt when some of the monks laughed, as if I dared to suggest they had anything to learn from a Christian. Well, I’ve learned a lot from John Spong, not least being: ‘Religion will die of boredom long before it dies of controversy.’</p>
<p>Now he’s got a new <a href="http://walkingwithintegrity.blogspot.com/2009/10/manifesto-from-our-friend-bishop-john.html?spref=fb">manifesto</a>. It echoes a feeling I’ve had for a long time now. For many years I’ve given up dogfighting with monks over nuns. I just do my thing, and make my research and studies available for anyone who is interested. This last little while I have felt called in to defend my teacher, in accordance with the Vinaya, when he was abandoned by his friends. These words have not, in the main, been intended for the fundamentalists – the Walters – but for those out there, insulated from Sangha realities and confused by this turn of events. Now that we know where we stand, i hope to return to a more normal life.</p>
<p>But don’t despair. ‘Normal’ is a relative term…</p>
