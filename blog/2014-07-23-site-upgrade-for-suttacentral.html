    <h1>Site upgrade for&nbsp;SuttaCentral</h1>

    <p>We just launched the new edition of SuttaCentral: </p>
<p><a href="http://suttacentral.net/" rel="nofollow">http://suttacentral.net/</a></p>
<p>This is the first major redesign since we relaunched last year. We’re very proud of the new features. It’s been designed to be mobile-friendly from ground up, to be at once more powerful, and also more minimal. </p>
<p>The main changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The top menu</strong> now displays all of the entries for the relevant category at once, so you can get anywhere from anywhere.
</li>
<li><strong>Each text page (i.e. the actual suttas) has a sidebar.</strong> The various tools, navigation and so on is in the sidebar, and the page itself is completely clean.</li>
<li><strong>Pali to Spanish lookup</strong>, to complement our Pali to English. We can add any number of languages to this, all we need is a Pali to Whatever dictionary in some kind of structured format. If you’ve gt anything like that, let us know.</li>
<li><strong>Home page redesign</strong>, with a “Quote of the Day” and new introduction.
</li>
<li><strong>Many minor corrections</strong>, such as sorting out the numbering of several Khuddaka texts (including the Dhammapada), and a multitude of typos and the like.
</li>
<li><strong>Fully responsive design</strong>. The previous design was okay on mobiles, but the new site should adapt well for any screen. We’ve included a whole range of tweaks to optimize the experience on mobiles.</li></ul>

<p>There will, of course, be some bugs, so please let us know if you find any: <a href="http://suttacentral.userecho.com/" rel="nofollow">http://suttacentral.userecho.com/</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
