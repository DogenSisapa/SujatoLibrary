    <p>As the response to the Perth bhikkhuni ordination resonates around the world, sitting on the fence is becoming more and more difficult. Only a tiny percentage of the Western monks have come forward to state their position, most of them being in favor of bhikkhuni ordination in principle. A shrinking few are still officially undecided. It is a position that becomes harder to sustain as time goes on. </p>
<p>And there’s a big problem: as long as people are sitting on the fence, it can’t be torn down. There’s only one outcome to the ‘bhikkhuni question’, and the longer the fence-sitters stay up there, the more it will drag on. So come on down! We’re a friendly mob.</p>
