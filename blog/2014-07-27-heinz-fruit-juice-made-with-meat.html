    <p>My friends at the Hindu Council have just let me know of a letter they received from Heinz, which admits that some of their juices contain animal products:</p>
<blockquote><p>The clear apple juice used in the Golden Circle ambient (long life) juice and drink range is made clear using a variety of clarifying agents one of which is from a beef source</p></blockquote>
<p>It really is kind of gross, when you eat things you just don’t have a clue what’s in it. Juice is the last place you’d expect to find animal products, but there you go. </p>
