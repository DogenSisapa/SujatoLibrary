    <p>Here it is: how to get, achieve, and have anything you want.</p>
<p>1) Neglect<br/>
Just don’t do it. Ignore things. Let ’em rot, because there’s something more important. You can only achieve something good by not doing a million other good things.</p>
<p>2) Never plan anything<br/>
Plans are alright, I suppose, if you have to keep some bureaucrat happy, but boy do they waste time. Ditch the plan, jump in the ditch, and start digging. Learn on the job.</p>
<p>3) Do what works<br/>
If it’s not working, why waste your time? See what gets results, and do that. Use your precious time as if it was precious.</p>
<p>4) Committees are for talking, not doing<br/>
I’m on stacks of committees and groups. They’re great, they give me a chance to get to know and work with all kinds of interesting people. One thing I’ve learnt: never try to work out details in a committee. Get the general outline, the sense of the direction, and appoint one or two people to go away and work stuff out.</p>
<p>5) Don’t listen to your guitar teacher<br/>
Mine was great – Barry Weeks, a patient teacher and skilled musician. But he said to me, ‘Don’t make what you love your life’. Sorry, Barry, but I did. And I never regretted it.</p>
<p>6) Old is better<br/>
It just is. Except for Ubuntu, which is awesome.</p>
<p>7) No-one beats the Buddha<br/>
Ever.</p>
