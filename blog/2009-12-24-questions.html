    <p>I was a bit surprised to see that one of our commenters say he didn’t think to ask me a question directly, as he didn’t think a monk would reply. I read all the comments, and try to answer the direct questions raised in the comments, and to reply elsewhere when I have something to say. Of course i can’t reply personally to each posting, much as I would like. </p>
<p>But i’d like to give you a chance to ask questions or raise topics that i haven’t posted on. I’ll try to do this from time to time, and will do my best to answer any questions – although you’re all also invited to have a go! So if there’s something you’d like to raise, please do so in the comments – what is a pressing Dhamma issue for you?</p>
