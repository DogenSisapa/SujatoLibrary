    <p>Dear &amp; beloved readers &amp; commenters,</p>
<p>For the next week I’m down in Melbourne for the Parliament of World Religions. I’ll be mostly taking the well-earned chance to just sit and listen for a while, although I am doing one workshop on metta meditation. I’m staying with the BSV, who have kindly allowed me to be with them for these few days. I doubt if I’ll have much chance to blog, so don’t worry if you don’t hear from me for a while.</p>
