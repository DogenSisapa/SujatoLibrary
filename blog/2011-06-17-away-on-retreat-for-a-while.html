    <p>For all my dear fellow bloggists, I’ll have to take leave of you for 10 days or so, while I’m teaching a retreat here at Jhana Grove, WA. If I don’t get around to answering all questions or responding to all comments that deserve a response, I hope you’ll forgive me. If you really want me to respond, best ask again when I’m back.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, when you leave comments, WordPress decides automatically what gets included and what doesn’t, and like all automated systems it sometimes makes mistakes. I will get around to check all submitted comments sooner or later, but meanwhile follow the sagely advice of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dontpanic_1024.jpg">Hitchhiker’s Guide</a>. One tip: if your post includes several links, it is more likely to be held back (because spam often includes links).</p>
