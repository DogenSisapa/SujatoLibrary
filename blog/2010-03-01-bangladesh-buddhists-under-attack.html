    <p>There is a heightening of violence against the minority Buddhist communities in Bangladesh, according to <a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,8963,0,0,1,0">recent reports</a>. This link gives the news, as well as a suggested list of actions.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve known a few Bangladeshi bhikkhus, and know somewhat of their difficulties. There are a few minority ethnic groups in remoter parts of Bangladesh, who are traditional followers of Theravada Buddhism. Over many years there have been serious, but sporadic, incidents of violence and repression. Now this simmering conflict has boiled over, and the world just became a little less kind.</p>
