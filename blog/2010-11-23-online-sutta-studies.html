    <p>Great news: Ven Analayo has just announced he will be conducting a <a href="http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/index.php?id=121&amp;L=0">series of online Sutta studies through the University of Hamburg</a>. These will benefit from the very thorough study Ven Analayo has been conducting for the past several years into the Majjhima Nikaya/Madhyama Agama on text-critical and comparative lines.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, just a few days ago I was discussing this with a few people and lamenting how Ven Analayo’s work was not more widely available. So now it is! And, thanks to Terrance, we have a link that gives <a href="http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/analayo/publications.htm">lots of Ven Analayo’s past articles and essays freely available online.</a> Essential reading for those interested in early Buddhism.</p>
