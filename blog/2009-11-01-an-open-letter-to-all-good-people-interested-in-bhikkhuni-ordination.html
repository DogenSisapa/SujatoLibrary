    <p>In the immediate response to Ajahn Brahm informing Ajahn Sumedho of the bhikkhuni ordination, I quickly composed a letter detailing some of the response (or lack thereof) on the part of the Wat Pa Pong (Ajahn Chah tradition) Sangha to bhikkhuni ordination. That letter was widely circulated. I was criticized for a few of the things in that original letter, especially for quoting some statements made by people in personal emails. I apologize for this, and ask that if anyone has the original version of the letter that it be deleted. Please use the revised version here.</p>
