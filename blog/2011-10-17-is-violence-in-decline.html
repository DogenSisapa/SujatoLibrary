    <p>Steven Pinker has just published a book on the long-term decline of violence in human society. It’s a fascinating thesis he’s been developing for the past several years. Here’s a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/oct/15/steven-pinker-better-angels-violence-interview">review plus interview on the Guardian</a>; a <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2011/09/john-gray-steven-pinker-violence-review/">rebuttal by John Gray</a>; and more in-depth charts and analysis on <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">edge.org</a>.</p>
<p>I must admit, I have a lot of sympathy for his ideas. In the early Buddhist texts, there are casual descriptions of tortures and brutal punishments that would horrify anyone today. For adultery, for example, a woman has her hands and feet cut off and she is left to bleed to death on the charnel ground. This cultural background makes the Buddha’s non-violence and compassionate approach to discipline seem all the more extraordinary.</p>
