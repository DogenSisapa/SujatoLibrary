    <h3>Religion and Violence in Southern Thailand</h3>
<h4>Michael K. Jerryson</h4>
<p>Thanks to Annie for bringing this to my attention. This is a study of the religious and social context of the ongoing violence in Southern Thailand between Thai Buddhists and ethnically Malay Muslims. You can read the introduction on <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ab05J9pzX1QC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Google books</a>. It looks like an excellent study, based on extensive personal interviews over several years. </p>
<p>The conflict in southern Thailand has been a dreadful one, with over 3000 dead and no signs of stopping. It provides an example of how the Buddhist philosophy of peace works in real-world contexts of violence.</p>
