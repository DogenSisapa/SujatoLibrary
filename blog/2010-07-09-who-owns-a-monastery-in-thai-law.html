    <h1>Who owns a monastery in Thai&nbsp;law?</h1>
    <p><em>2010-07-09T17:40:03</em></p>
    <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://sujato.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/who-owns-a-monastery-in-thai-law/">https://sujato.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/who-owns-a-monastery-in-thai-law/</a></p>
    <p>It is generally understood that monasteries in Thailand are owned by the Sangha as a whole, and administered by the local Sangha, especially the abbot. The Sangha as a whole here is not the ‘Sangha of the Four Quarters’, but the Sangha as legally recognized under the jurisdiction of Thai law, that is, the ‘Thai Sangha’.</p>
<p>In fact the situation is complex. While in Thailand I stayed in formally recognized monasteries, in hermitages in national parks occupied under an agreement  with the national Parks authorities, and in little places that were in fact likely to be just squats. In some cases the land is originally made over to the monastery from the ‘commons’ owned by the local villagers; in other cases it is purchased from a single owner. The actual title owner of the land may not be clear in every case.</p>
<p>The Thai Sangha Act is not particularly helpful in this regard, and seems to take the question as a matter of course. Probably it is handled largely through custom and the decisions of the central authorities.</p>
<p>Here are some of the relevant statements from the first and the current Thai Sangha Acts. I include some passages from the outdated Act of 1902 as it clarifies some points omitted in the later versions. In particular, it clarifies that the ownership of a monastery is transferred from the (presumably lay) donor to the Sangha. And in the critical question of the election of the abbot, it stipulates that the villagers, local Sangha, a local administrative head should meet together to decide. This is still followed in Thailand. No doubt practice varies, but this is what happened in one Wat Pa Pong branch monastery that I was staying near in Nan, northern Thailand.</p>
<p>For your interest, here is the official text of all three <a href="http://sujato.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sangha-acts.pdf">Thai Sangha Acts</a>.</p>
