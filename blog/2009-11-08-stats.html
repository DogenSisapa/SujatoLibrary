    <p>I’ve just checked the stats for this blog, and it’s had 16 400 hits since starting two weeks ago; almost all are in the last week.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I worked for, what, three years on my <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/bhikkhuni-vinaya-studies/5947878">Bhikkhuni Vinaya Studies</a>. So far, a grand total of zero orders. Maybe I’ve been missing something…</p>
<p>I had no idea this whole bhikkhuni thing would unleash such an energy. This is something I could feel in myself very clearly. For about a week before and after the ordination, I hardly slept, I felt this amazing joy and vitality. I’ve been working for this for so long, finally the blockages were gone. And this is the sense I get from the feedback we’ve been hearing from all around: how much hidden, suppressed energy is starting to appear. For now the energy is shooting in random directions – but just wait until it gets really harnessed.</p>
