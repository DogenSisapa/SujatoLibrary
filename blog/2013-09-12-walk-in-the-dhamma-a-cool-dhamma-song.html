    <p>Many years ago I was asked to write a Buddhist national anthem for Australia. I came up with the following set of lyrics, to the tune of Waltzing Matilda (which should totally be our real national anthem!). I forgot about these for years, until recently Dana Murty asked for a copy (thanks, Dana!). I though I’d post them here for your enjoyment.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once a jolly Buddha camped by a running stream<br/>
Under the shade of a Bodhi tree<br/>
And he sat and meditated ’till his mind was free<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?</p>
<p>Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?<br/>
And he sat and meditated ’till his mind was free<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?</p>
<p>He walked that dusty road down to Benares<br/>
To see the five monks staying in the Deer Park<br/>
And he taught the four noble truths, the Dhamma he himself had seen:<br/>
Suffering, its origin, cessation, the path.</p>
<p>Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?<br/>
And he taught the four noble truths, the Dhamma he himself had seen<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?</p>
<p>When Kondannya heard about the middle way<br/>
The noble eightfold path that leads to peace of mind<br/>
The vision of the Dhamma arose within him clear to see<br/>
And so the Buddha said: ‘Kondannya understands!’</p>
<p>Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?<br/>
The vision of the Dhamma arose within him clear to see<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?</p>
<p>And now the Buddha’s teaching has come to this big empty land<br/>
With waratah and wallabies and scribbly-bark trees<br/>
And the ghost of the Buddha may be heard inside the monasteries:<br/>
‘Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?’</p>
<p>Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Walk in the Dhamma<br/>
Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?<br/>
And the ghost of the Buddha may be heard inside the monasteries:<br/>
‘Who’ll come and walk in the Dhamma with me?’</p></blockquote>
