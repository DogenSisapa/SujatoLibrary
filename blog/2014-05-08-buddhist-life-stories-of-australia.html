    <p>There’s an exciting new project to document the lives of Buddhists in Australia. They’re looking for community support, and have produced a short video.</p>

<p>And here’s some background info.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear friends and colleagues,</p>
<p>We are very excited to inform you about the successful launch of the Pozible-Deakin Research My World crowdfunding campaign, Buddhist Life Stories of Australia. </p>
<p>You can view the wonderful campaign video here, which features many of Australia’s prominent Buddhist leaders: <a href="http://www.pozible.com/buddhistlifestoriesaustralia" rel="nofollow">http://www.pozible.com/buddhistlifestoriesaustralia</a>. </p>
<p>You can also make contributions to support the project directly on this website. All contributions are tax-deductible and we highly appreciate all pledges large or small. Our goal is to raise $10,000 in 45 days and we are off to a great start already!</p>
<p>We are extremely grateful to all who have offered advice and feedback in the development of this project. We are especially grateful to Venerable Ajahn Brahm, Venerable Thich Phuoc Tan, Venerable Chi Kwang, Venerable Robina Courtin, Venerable Bhante Sujato, Kim Hollow, and Laura Chan, who have all kindly contributed to the video. As you can see in the video, the research team only worked with a basic, minimal script — it is the generous support of Buddhist leaders that have made it such a touching and moving video. And this is what excites us the most about this project: that it is a collaborative process between the research team and the broader Buddhist community.</p>
<p>We envision this present project as the modest first step of a larger, long-term program that will allow us to document more life stories, not only of ordained members of the Sangha but also the lay community. Buddhism in Australia is diverse, vibrant, and multicultural – all sorts of flowers of different shapes and colours. We are so blessed and grateful to be part of this with you.</p>
<p>Please help us spread the word about this campaign among the Buddhist councils and your other networks. And please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries or if you wish to explore ways to actively publicise the campaign at your location. We would be most grateful for your assistance.</p>
<p>You can also stay updated about the campaign via Facebook and Twitter</p>
