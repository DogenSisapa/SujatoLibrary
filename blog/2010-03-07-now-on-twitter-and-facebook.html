    <p>If I’ve done it right, this blog will now automatically update to facebook and twitter accounts I’ve set up as ‘sujato’. I don’t use either of those apps, so I’m not really sure if it works yet. This is just for the convenience of anyone who does use them – obviously, lots of you. I won’t be following or checking either of these places regularly, so if you want to join the conversation, here’s still the place.</p>
