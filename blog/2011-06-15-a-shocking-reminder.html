    <h1>A shocking reminder&#8230;</h1>

    <p>A group called <a href="http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/womens-rights/">TrustLaw </a>has just released a list of the five worst countries to be a woman. The details are distressing, but essential: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/15/worst-place-women-afghanistan-india">a sobering reminder of just how much brutality the women of this world endure every day</a>. The fact that Afghanistan tops the list is no surprise, but is especially ironic given how the status of women was regularly trotted out as one of the reasons to go to war. </p>
<p>How can we live in a world that just lets this happen? And how can it be that most of the worldâ€™s religions still treat women as lesser beings?</p>
