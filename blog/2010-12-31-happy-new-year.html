    <p>And here’s one of my favorite images; it’s the golden mistletoe that still lives while all around is bleak and grey. This was the ‘golden bough’ that Aeneas plucked as ticket for entry into the Underworld. It became the central metaphor in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623">James Frazer’s monumental book of the same name.</a> If you haven’t read it, you should!</p>
<p>The mistletoe shows that, even when we think everything is dead, life persists. The old year dies today, and from that the new is born. May this year be full of joy and the growth of wisdom for us all!</p>
