    <p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Happy year of the snake for all of you!</p>
<p>Just to let you know I’m still around. I’ve been visiting other realms; you know, outside of blogspace. Actually I’ve been spending a lot of time on suttacentral.net and the Authenticity Project. I’ll get to your comments soon and hopefully to some more articles before long.</p>
<p>Currently I’m in Sydney, where I’ve been teaching quite regularly. In addition to the regular groups in North Sydney, Baulkham Hills, and Parramatta, I’ve started teaching meditation with our long term supporter Gia Hieu for the Vietnamese community in Panania. The Vietnamese community has for a long time been major supporters of Santi and other monasteries in Sydney, yet there is not much in the way of meditation teachings for them, especially in English for the young ones. So hopefully I can give something back. The session was in Gia Hieu’s house, but from next time we are moving to a community center in the same area. If you live nearby I hope to see you there next month!</p>
<p>Last night I taught at the Sydney Gay Meditation Group. They’re a great group, who really practice kindness and care in how they present the whole evening. I suggested that they could get a career consulting for Buddhist event organization!</p>
<p>This morning, I’m off down to Santi for a visit, the first time since I left last year. Looking forward to seeing the community and catching up with everyone.</p>
<p>And of course on Sunday the Early Buddhism course kicks off. The session in Sydney has had an overwhelming response; we had to cut off registrations at 50, but I suspect a few might try to sneak in through the side door. Which is doubly impressive when you consider the Buddhist Library doesn’t even have a side door. I’m getting nervous: I’d better do the reading otherwise I could be in trouble…</p>
