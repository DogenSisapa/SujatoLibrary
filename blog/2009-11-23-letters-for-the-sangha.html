    <p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Many of you know of, and hopefully have signed, the petition for bhikkhunis. The organizers of this petition were a group of concerned lay people who came together to address the gender inequality within the Sangha. They plan to deliver the petition to the Ajahns of before the upcoming Western Abbots Meeting, December 7-9 at Wat Pa Nanachat, Thailand. </p>
<p>In addition, the organizers would like to present some letters for the Ajahns, and have invited contribution from the visitors to this blog.</p>
<p>The letters should be respectful, brief, and from-the-heart. We want your voices to be heard.</p>
<p>Please send your letters to: sanghaletters@yahoo.co.uk</p>
