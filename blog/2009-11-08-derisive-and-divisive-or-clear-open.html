    <p>For my readers, and especially leavers of comments, thanks so much for all contributing to make this space something for us all to learn from.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that some of my comments have been a little – how to say – strong? Impolite? Extreme? I’m trying things out, feeling my way towards a better way of communicating. Some people say what I’ve said is ‘clear and open elucidations’, others that it is ‘derisive and divisive’, more fit for an American political blog than a Buddhist monk. (Ouch! That hurt. Unless it’s Michael Moore, of course.) </p>
<p>What do you think? Should I change my style? Are there things that are offensive and better removed? Or am I on the right track – perhaps not open enough? Will I become known as the Richard Dawkins of Buddhism – or the Sarah Palin? </p>
<p>Over to you…</p>
