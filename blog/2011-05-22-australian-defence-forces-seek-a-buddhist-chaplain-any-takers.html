    <p>The number of Buddhists in the Australian Defence Forces has now exceeded 350. This means the ADF is seeking a chaplain to minister to their needs. This issue has been discussed a number of times over the years, but it is only now that the number of Buddhists is great enough that the ADF is actively seeking a chaplain for them.</p>
<p>The role would be as an officer, who would receive basic ‘brush &amp; comb’ training in protocol and so on, but would not go through boot camp. They would minister to the spiritual needs of Buddhists in the Defence Forces – which, one can imagine, would be a tough call.</p>
<p>This call has come through the FABC. If anyone’s interested, let me know and I’ll put you in touch.</p>
<p>In this <a href="http://sujato.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/resource-package-related-to-buddhist-chaplaincy.docx">Resource Package Related to Buddhist Chaplaincy</a>, you’ll find an interesting selection of material on this issue, complied by the ADF. </p>
