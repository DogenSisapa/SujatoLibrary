    <p>There’s been a scam going for maybe a year or so now, with people hacking into email accounts and sending distress messages. I received one myself just today. Here it is, with the names removed, so you get an idea what’s what.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Hope you get this on time? Sorry I didn’t inform you about my trip to Uk  for a program, I am presently in Surrey and am having some difficulties here because i misplaced my wallet on my way to the hotel where my money and other valuable things were. presently my passport and my things are been held down by the hotel management pending when i make payment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I need you to help me with a loan of (1,850 pounds= $2,900)  to pay my hotel bills and to get myself back home. I will appreciate whatever you can afford to assist me with, I will refund the money back to you as soon as i return, let me know if you can be of any help? ASAP.  I don’t have a phone where i can be reached. I am so confused right now.  please let me know immediately</div>
<p>Your help is much appreciated,<br/>
Thank you very much,</p>
<p>From XXXXX</p></blockquote>
<p>The emails are all very much of the same form, though the wording changes. They’ve all been from supposed monastics stranded in England for some reason. Just after I first posted this, I received yet another one, this time from Bhikkhu Bodhi. If you google some of the phrases in the message you’ll find other examples.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you get an email like this from ‘me’ or any other monastic, best to ignore it. You can reply if you like to let them know their account has been hacked. But remember that the hacker will see your email…</p>
<p>In my original post, I said that my email had been hacked. I just found out this was a mistake, sorry for the confusion. But the issue is still real…</p>
