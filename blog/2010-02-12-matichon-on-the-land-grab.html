    <p>The Thai daily newspaper Matichon (11-2-2010) has reported an official response to the request by Wat Pa Pong to have Ajahn Brahm expelled from Bodhinyana monastery and the land turned over to WPP. </p>
<p>The articles says that the Thai National Office of Buddhism has written to WPP, saying that it would be difficult to take the property, as it rests with the decision of the lay committee (BSWA), who are very supportive of Ajahn Brahm.</p>
<p>It seems the Thai officials want to continue to stay out of the affair, and are simply using a legal pretext rather than making a stand on principle. This is a common technique in Thai politics. Itâ€™s good that the official managers of Thai Buddhism have an understanding of the law. The Walters of WPP are simply intent on grabbing what they can and continuing their malicious persecution of Ajahn Brahm. There are more machinations afoot behind the scenes, and I will post about these when i have some more definite information.</p>
