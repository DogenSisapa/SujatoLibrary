    <p>Iâ€™ve been following the development of the global <a href="http://charterforcompassion.org/">Charter of Compassion</a>, an idea developed by the wonderful Karen Armstrong following her receipt of the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> prize. This is a truly powerful idea, one that I hope will have a great impact on how we see ourselves as humanity.</p>
<p>The final Charter for Compassion is to be unveiled on November 12, and I hope you will all follow and support this initiative. </p>
<p>I was honored to be invited to take part in a multi-faith photograph for the Charter tomorrow at the Opera House. I love doing interfaith work so much, there are so many wise and compassionate people out there. </p>
<p>We all need to do our bit to use religion to respond creatively and constructively to our environment, making it a force for helping rather than hurting, fostering love and inclusiveness, not alienation and ignorance. </p>
