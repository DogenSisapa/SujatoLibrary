    <p>A couple of years ago Beatrice Alba and I discussed the fact that there were many academic studies of mindfulness meditation, but few of metta. Although simply complaining about the situation is usually a pleasant enough experience, for some reason we decided to actually do something about it. Go figure!</p>
<p>So for two metta retreats we handed out forms and got people to fill them in, according to a scheme that Beatrice worked out. She wrote an analysis of the findings, and it’s now been published in the journal <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rcbh20/current#.UpaVc9IW2Sr" target="_blank">Contemporary Buddhism</a>. Congrats to Beatrice for putting in the work and helping put our knowledge of metta meditation on a more scientific footing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the article is behind a paywall, so those of you without institutional affiliation will have to pay the ludicrous sum of $37 to download the pdf file. Or, if you don’t feel like enriching the pockets of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informa" target="_blank">multinational corporation that clears some $150 million in profit every year</a> from the ideas and work of others, you could contact me.</p>
<p>The gist of the study: metta meditation is good. You knew that! But now it’s peer-reviewed, so it must be true. </p>
