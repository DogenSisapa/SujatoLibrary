    <h1>A new theme&#8230;</h1>

    <p>I’ve updated the theme to use Punchcut – I hope you like it! I was motivated to change because I wanted something softer, and I noticed that the sites whose <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/">typography</a> I admire used a screen-suited serif font, with lots of white space, generous line height, and set ragged-right (rather than justified: because browsers and other automatic systems don’t do a very good job of justifying text.)</p>
