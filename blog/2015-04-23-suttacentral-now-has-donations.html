    <p>SuttaCentral is now accepting donations.</p>
<p><a class="call-to-action" href="https://suttacentral.net/donations" target="_blank">Donate to SuttaCentral</a></p>
<p>In the past we did not set up a donations facility, as we had enough funds for our limited needs. Now, however, we are employing a full time developer, in addition to several other ongoing costs, such as typing the texts in several languages. So we have set this up to guarantee our future stability.</p>
<p>The work behind the scenes has been mainly done by Deepika, who has set up the SuttaCentral Development Trust. Details are on <a href="https://suttacentral.net/donations" target="_blank">our Donations page</a>.</p>
<p>The facility has been set up using the secure modern payment system, Stripe.</p>
<p>If you think SuttaCentral is amazing, now you can help us make it even better.</p>
