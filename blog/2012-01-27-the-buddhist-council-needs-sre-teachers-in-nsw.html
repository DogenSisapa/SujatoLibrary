    <p>Here’s a message from the Buddhist Council of NSW. It’s an important issue, one that I’ve spoken of many times: we need more people to help with teaching Dhamma to kids in schools. Can you help?</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Friends</p>
<p>We currently have around 60 volunteer SRE teachers (Special Religious Education) sharing Dharma with children in Government primary schools around the state.</p>
<p>We also have  around 50 schools on our waiting list!</p>
<p>The beginning of the school year always sees enquiries from schools new to us wanting an SRE teacher – it’s a busy time for the team that supports our volunteer teachers and they could use more help – if you are interested in volunteering on the SRE support team (or as an SRE teacher!!) please email <a href="mailto:office@buddhistcouncil.org" target="_blank">office@buddhistcouncil.org</a> a brief resume.</p>
<p>For a glimpse of their wonderful work here’s the SRE support team’s inaugral newsletter.. <a href="http://buddhistcouncil.org/teaching/uploads/DecemberNewsletter.pdf" target="_blank">http://buddhistcouncil.org/teaching/uploads/DecemberNewsletter.pdf</a></p></blockquote>
