    <p>The front page of the Guardian today featured a lovely, full length article about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/zen-thich-naht-hanh-buddhidm-business-values">Thich Nhat Hahn’s approach to mindfulness and nature</a>. It’s great to see a respectful treatment of a genuine spiritual approach in a paper more typically associated with a sceptical point of view. </p>
