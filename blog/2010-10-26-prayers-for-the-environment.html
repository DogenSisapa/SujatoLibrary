    <p>I’ve been asked to contribute Buddhist prayers for the environment for an interfaith site. I’m embarrassed to admit I don’t know any – except one verse in a traditional Pali Chant:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sammā-dhāraṁ pavecchanto<br/>
Kāle devo pavassatu.<br/>
Vuḍḍhi-bhāvāya sattānaṁ<br/>
Samiddhaṁ netu medaniṁ.<br/>
Mātā-pitā ca atra-jaṁ<br/>
Niccaṁ rakkhanti puttakaṁ.<br/>
Evaṁ dhammena rājāno<br/>
Pajaṁ rakkhantu sabbadā</p></blockquote>
<p>Which i have loosely translated as:</p>
<blockquote><p>May the rain fall from the heavens, showering in the right season!<br/>
May the earth’s growing bounty bring prosperity for all beings!<br/>
As a mother and father always protect their own child,<br/>
So may the righteous rulers always protect their subjects!</p></blockquote>
<p>I have had a quick look on the web for other Buddhist environment prayers, ancient or modern, but i can’t find any. Does anyone know of any – maybe by Thich Nhat Hahn?</p>
