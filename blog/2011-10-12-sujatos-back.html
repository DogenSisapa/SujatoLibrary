    <p>Greetings to all inhabitants of the internet. Vassa is over for another year (insert sad face icon here) and life starts another round. I’ll get back into posting and curating this blog on a more regular basis. Meanwhile, as usual I say ‘no’ to almost all requests in the vassa, which means there’s a lot of ‘yessing’ to catch up with. For your information, here’s a list of my upcoming events. I hope I can see some of you there! These notes are very brief, please just ask if you want more info on any details. The first two events have already happened, so if you weren’t there you’ve missed out, unless you’re a neutrino or a Sarvastivadin.</p>
