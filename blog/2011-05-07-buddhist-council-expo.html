    <p>I’m just on my way back from the first day of the Buddhist Council of NSW’s Vesak month expo. This year the BCNSW is putting on its expo over two weekends in two locations. This weekend is at Cabramatta (PYCY Hall, 162 Railway Parade), next weekend is at Marrickville Town Hall (303 Marrickville Rd).</p>
<p>There’s displays and information about different Buddhist centers and activities, and a rolling schedule of teachings through the day. And, of course, lots of Buddhist friends to meet and get to know.</p>
<p>I’ll be back tomorrow for a couple of sessions. Perhaps I might see you there!</p>
