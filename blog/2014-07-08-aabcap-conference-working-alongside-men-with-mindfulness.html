    <p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.feelguide.com/2013/04/29/75-years-in-th-making-harvard-just-released-its-epic-study-on-what-men-require-to-live-a-happy-life/" target="_blank">This important study on men’s well-being has just been published</a>. The major findings: no. 1 cause of harm for men is alcohol; no. 1 cause of happiness is love. Somehow this seems familiar; where have I heard this before…</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Colleagues and Friends,</p>
<p>Please join us for AABCAP’s  8th Annual Conference where you will meet with old friends and make new friends.  </p>
<p>This year our conference aims to explore men’s changing roles in society and how this effects both men and women.</p>
<p>This year we have done something slightly different, we have brought together 13 speakers, all with a Buddhist background, over a 100 years experience of specialisation working with men, to explore the unique challenges that we all, men and women, face as men navigate modern day Australian life.  When half the population suffers the other half also suffers.  </p>
<p>Talks will cover topics such as men and violence,working with Indigenous men, men and sex, men in relationships, corporate men, men and midlife and ageing and death.<br/>
As well, among the many papers we will also provide the opportunity for discussions, panels, and experiential sessions.  Our speakers will bring us personal experiences of growing up male, as well their many years professional experience working in mental health with men.</p>
<p>In over 20 years working in Mental Health as a social worker and psychotherapist I have never been invited to a conference that specifically focuses on gender, in particular male gender, and the ways in which gender needs should be considered when working in a therapeutic alliance.   Our ethical frameworks in mental health ask for us to be open and accepting of differences in ethnicity, religions, disabilities, and gender.  And yet we receive little to no training in these areas.</p>
<p>This conference aims to explore some of the biases that each of us male and female therapists bring to our relationships; from our personal experiences as well our socio-cultural contexts, both of which can keep us from being helpful.  </p>
<p>And in the end the idea is to enable conversations that enrich how women and men live more peacefully together.</p>
<p>If you have already registered or are participating perhaps you might like to send this on to your collegues and friends.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your ongoing support.</p>
<p>With Metta,</p>
<p>Genevieve<br/>
President AABCAP</p></blockquote>
