    <p>Here’s a few articles from the New York Times on the recent investigations into the nuns of the US. </p>

<p>While the nuns do much of the hands-on work for the Church, they have become increasingly suspected of drifting away from the Vatican’s priorities. The tenor of the criticism is captured in this statement attributed to Cardinal Levada, who replaced Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope) as the head of the the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cardinal Levada sent a letter to the Leadership Conference saying an investigation was warranted because it appeared that the organization had done little since it was warned eight years ago that it had failed to “promote” the church’s teachings on three issues: the male-only priesthood, homosexuality and the primacy of the Roman Catholic Church as the means to salvation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s stunning how ‘Christianity’ is absent from these tenets. Comparisons with recent developments in Thailand are, alas, inevitable.</p>
