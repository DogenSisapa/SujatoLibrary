    <p>As Expo 2011 is rapidly approaching the Buddhist Council of NSW is calling for volunteers to help with security, guiding, logistics, general helpers…training provided!! If you are able to help NOW is the time to let the BCNSW know – Expo is the first two weekends in May. Please see the <a href="http://www.buddhistfestivalmonth.org.au/">website</a> for details. To register your interest, email contacts@buddhistfestivalmonth.org.au</p>
<p>If you are able to distribute flyers to your local community and contacts please contact the BCNSW with mailing address, preferred language (we have English, Chinese and Vietnamese) – the BCNSW will gratefully send bundles of 30 or 50 (or more).</p>
