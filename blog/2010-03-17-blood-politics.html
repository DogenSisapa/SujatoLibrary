    <p>You’ve probably read of the ongoing blood protests in Thailand. The ‘Red Shirt’ Thaksin supporters have collected blood from their supporters to pour on the parliament. It’s all symbolic, but no-one seems to quite know what its symbolic of.</p>
<p>You can read it as ‘the blood of the people’, and so on. But, ahem, Thaksin himself spilt quite a lot of that when he was in power, so that may not be such a good idea. A better bet are the various black magic theories, which were the subject of a TV debate in Thailand. (See <a href="http://www.somtow.org/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/16/thailand-human-blood-protest">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The blood pouring ceremony was headed by a Hindu Brahmin and a man carrying a statue of the Buddha. Mantras and so on were muttered, which shows that, at the very least, there’s more to it than just a symbol of political protest. Of course, last time it was the Yellow Shirts who used blood in their protests: they gathered the used sanitary products from their women supporters and placed them around a ‘powerful’ monument in Bangkok to undo the supposed magic of the Red Shirts.</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/34536/political-rallies-banned-near-govt-property-in-chiang-mai">monks have been at the forefront</a>, both in <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/features/article_1541395.php/In-Pictures-Thailand-Political-Protest-with-Bottles-of-Blood?page=12">giving blood</a> and <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/features/article_1541395.php/In-Pictures-Thailand-Political-Protest-with-Bottles-of-Blood?page=13">attending the rallies</a>.</p>
<p>So who to support? Thaksin, a known criminal who raised corruption and nepotism to new levels in his term as PM, but who keeps getting elected because of his populist policies? Or the anti-democratic yellow Shirts, who avowedly want to undo the limited success of Thailand’s democracy, returning power where it belongs: the Bangkok elite? After such progress during the 90s, i feel so sad for Thailand that they are faced with this miserable choice.</p>
