    <h1>“Sooner or later, we’ll see female monks&nbsp;everywhere.”</h1>
    <p><em>2009-12-28T23:25:23</em></p>
    <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/wat-pa-pong-press-conference/">https://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/wat-pa-pong-press-conference/</a></p>
    <p>On Dec 28, 2009, a press conference was held by a committee of senior Ajahns from Wat Pa Pong, calling for Thai State control over monasteries overseas.</p>
<p>The monks who are quoted in the reports are Ajahn Opas (Phra Kru Opaswuthikorn; more normally known as Luang Po Sophorn) and Ajahn Khampong (Phra Kru Sudhamprachote), both senior abbots in the WPP tradition; also Ajahn Kevali, the recently installed German aboot of Wat Nanachat, is mentioned. It is highly unlikely that the Western Ajahns were consulted, certainly not all of them or in detail. The conference represents the views of a council of 12 senior monks at WPP, which I believe is an <em>ad hoc</em> committee set up in the wake of the bhikkhuni ordination. They claim to represent WPP as a whole.</p>
<p>The press conference makes two things clear.</p>
<p>1. That WPP formally and seriously wishes to wrest control of Bodhinyana Monastery from Ajahn Brahm, using the legal apparatus of the Thai nation.<br/>
2. That women’s ordination in any form is fundamentally unacceptable.</p>
<p>An account of the press conference by Sanitsuda Ekachai is on the <a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,8813,0,0,1,0">Buddhist Channel</a>, which includes this summary of the issues:</p>
<blockquote><p>  If action is not taken, the council fears that more women could be ordained in the West.</p>
<p>    “Sooner or later, we’ll see female monks everywhere,” said Phra Kru Opaswuthikorn.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Rarely do we see the real issue expressed with such forthright clarity. Phra Opas has, mercifully, not studied in the school of monastic nonspeak. He knows what he believes, and says it. We have to stop the nuns, damn them up before they become a flood that overwhelms Buddhism. (As an aside, he reminds me of our very own Cardinal Pell, another unreconstructed patriarch who just sails on, oblivious to the changing currents around him.)</p>
<p>This is a powerful patriarch speaking, with his own monastery, his State-appointed title, entrusted by WPP with shaping the future of the Western WPP Sangha. I believe that those in such a position of spiritual leadership have a moral imperative to inform themselves and respond positively to the genuine spiritual needs and aspirations of their time. But here Phra Opas, and the WPP council he represents, is making a power play based on a sexist ideology. When those with much power try to strip away even the little power that others have, it is our ethical duty to stand up for the wronged and the deprived. There is no sign here of any wisdom that might help us understand how we as human beings must share this beautiful, fragile planet together.</p>
<p>Phra Opas forms his argument based on the supposed problems of the Thai people. I urge Thai people everywhere to let the rest of the world know what they really think. Lest it be forgotten, the Thai Senate subcommittee of 2003 declared that the 1928 ruling against female ordination was against the Thai constitution, specifically the clauses guaranteeing freedom of religion and gender equality. Please, my Thai friends, do not let Thai Buddhism be remembered for greed and narrow-mindedness. There is so much that Thai Buddhism has offered the world, and so much it has yet to offer.</p>
<p>The following is a first-hand report of the press conference by the Bangkok Post writer Sanitsuda Ekachai, copied here from Facebook.</p>
<blockquote><p>    Phra Kru Opaswuthikorn presided at the press conference today to urge the Office of National Buddhism and the Council of Elders to issue rules and regulations to empower the Thai Sangha to punish monks overseas who violate the Sangha’s mandates.</p>
<p>    Phra Kru Opas spoke on behalf of the Wat Pah Pong executive board which made this decision last week.</p>
<p>    Rough summary of press releases:</p>
<p>    The Perth ordination is against the Vinaya-Dharma of Thai Theravada Buddhism as well as violating the Wat Pah Pong’s prohibition against female ordination. Aj Brahm was summoned to admit his mistake which refused to do, resulting in the excommunication. This decision was later approved by Somdet Phra Puttajarn who said Aj Brahm’s preceptorship was therefore automatically revoked.</p>
<p>    Apart from ordaining women, Aj Brahm was also accused of temple mismanagement. The Bodhinyana Temple came into being through the faith and donations of Thai Buddhists in Perth. After the first abbot left monkhood, Aj Brahm was appointed as abbot and he later changed the temple bylaws and change the temple committee members for “his own interest” despite disagreement from the Bodhinyana Sangha.</p>
<p>    Given that the Bhikkhuni ordination and temple ownership problems have greatly troubled the Thai Buddhists in Australia, a committee should be set up to investigate land ownership and temple mismanagement at Bodhinyana in order to return the land and temple to the Thai Buddhists and to ensure that the temple management is in line with Dhamma Vinaya.</p>
<p>    To prevent future problems, rules and regulations should be issued so the Thai Sangha can punish the monks overseas who violate th laws and the clergy’s mandates.</p>
<p>    On temple ownership overseas, this poses a problem of control because temples are owned by associations not the Thai Sangha like temples in Thailand. Should the abbots err, they still can stay if the temple committee support them. Or, when the abbots are in the right, they cannot stay if they don’t have support of the committee. The management of temples in Thailand, however, is under Thai Sangha’s administrative structure. When problems occur like in the case of Bodhinyana, it is then difficult to move due to lack of uniform rules which effectively govern temples in Thailand. To prevent similar problems, there should be a state agency to enforce the Thai Sangha law and to cover temples overseas.</p>
<p>    I asked whether WPP sent emails to the Thai embasy and Sinporean organisers of Aj Brahm’s talks, the answer is no, WPP did not do that.</p>
<p>    Asked if this control effort have been approved by the Western clergy since it would affect the Western monks’ relative autonomy which is useful to their dharma work, the answer that it is the decision of the WPP board consisting of 12 senior monks. That it was approved by LP Liam. But the answer was not clear if the Western Sangha was fully consulted or not.</p>
<p>    Phra Kru Sudhamprachote said many Thai Buddhists in Perth are unhappy with Aj Brahm and are trying to find way to get him out the temple. But this is up to the people, WPP cannot do anything to support this action.</p>
<p>    I asked if WPP has an alternative to Bhikkhuni. Aj Kevali is in favour of the Siladhara order. But Phra Kru Opas outrightly dismissed it, saying it it would be difficult for the order to be accepted in Thailand. He described Bhikkhuni ordination as against the Dhamma Vinaya. That the Buddha advised monks to stay away from women, because women and monks are like fire and fuel.</p>
<p>    I asked what is the real issue concerning Aj Brahm, Bhikkhuni ordination or Aj Brahm’s secrecy and failure to consult the WPP clergy. Phra Kru Opas said the main issue is Bhikkhuni ordination. That there is no way that Thai Theravada Buddhism to have Bhikkhuni. And as far WPP concerns, Aj Brahm is no longer a Thai Theravada monk, but a Mahayana monk.</p>
<p>    My hunch : This might be part of the existing problems of internal politics between Thai and Western monks in the WPP order. Luang Por Chah wanted the Western clergy to oversee the Western monks. Consequently, Thai monks have no say on temples overseas. But the Perth ordination shows Aj Sumedho’s failure to keep the monks under his supervision in line so the Thai monks have the reason to step in to control the Western monks and the temple properties abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of critical points here.</p>
<p>Phra Kru Opas clearly states that the real issue is bhikkhuni ordination, which he says can never be accepted in Thai Buddhism. One the other hand, we have been told again and again by Western Ajahns that the real issue is not bhikkhuni ordination, but the ‘way it was done’. I give the Western Ajahns the benefit of the doubt here: I don’t think they are lying, I think they are just naive. They need to actively develop a culture of denial if they are to maintain the status quo and convince themselves that it is possible to remain with integrity within the existing structures of Thai State Buddhism. As I have said all along, and as the statement here confirms, there never was any possibility of advancing bhikkhuni ordination within the existing structures.</p>
<p>And, as I have also stated repeatedly, siladharas are no better in the eyes of the conservative Thai Sangha. Ordaining siladharas is just as illegal in Thailand as ordaining bhikkhunis – if the 1928 ruling is still in force – and Phra Kru Opas dismisses any chance that that order might make any headway in Thailand. The only advantage of the siladhara order is that it’s easy to dismiss it and not take it seriously. The plain fact is that if these ultra-conservative monks have their way, there is no chance of any improvement in women’s lot in Thai Buddhism.</p>
<p>The most astonishing accusations in Phra Opas’ statement concern the alleged temple mismanagement at Bodhinyana. These claims have no factual basis whatsoever. They are sheer invention. Anyone who knows Ajahn Brahm would know that he is the most scrupulous and dedicated manager imaginable. I’ve seen him personally check every call on the phone bill, and will harass Telstra if there’s the slightest problem. In three years as the secretary at Bodhinayana, I never saw anything but the highest standards of accountability and professionalism in Ajahn Brahm’s management. </p>
<p>The irony is that it was, in fact, Wat Nanachat that was badly mismanaged for many years, because most of the other Ajahns, understandably enough, are not so concerned or knowledgeable about such matters. It ended up with lay committee members ripping off much of the donations. This is not a criticism of the monks involved, they were simply being trusting. The rorts were only ended by Ajahn Nyanadhammo, who set up a rigorous system of checks on finances, which he had learnt from his time at Bodhinyana with Ajahn Brahm.</p>
<p>The notion that there are a set of ‘uniform rules’ that ‘effectively govern’ monasteries in Thailand is nonsense. Thai Buddhism is deeply troubled and in desperate need of internal reform. The scandals reported in the media are only the tip of the iceberg. Deeper and harder to deal with than <a href="http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2004/07/05/survey-aids-plaguing-2-out-10-thai-monks">AIDS</a> or <a href="http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/world/facts/113-thaimonk.htm">drug addiction</a> in the Sangha is the pervasive loss of spiritual relevance or meaningful Dhamma vocation. This cuts to the very heart of the contemporary Sangha, and is not a simple case of a few misbehaving monks.</p>
<p>Don’t take my word for it, look at the actions of Phra Mongkut, or Ajahn Mun, or Ajahn Chah. They all operated under the quite reasonable knowledge that mainstream Thai Buddhism was seriously corrupt, and that only by reforming or living on the margins of the system could one live with integrity. This is a staple part of the Forest Tradition, which is why the Forest Tradition monks set up such strong boundaries between themselves and other monks. Outsider monks are treated as if they are only semi-ordained, since it is assumed that if monks do not come from the forest tradition, they are probably guilty of many Vinaya offences. </p>
<p>A few more specifics need mention.</p>
<blockquote><p>   After the first abbot left monkhood, Aj Brahm was appointed as abbot and he later changed the temple bylaws and change the temple committee members for “his own interest” despite disagreement from the Bodhinyana Sangha.</p></blockquote>
<p>These claims are completely false, as anyone who has stayed at Bodhinyana would know. Ajahn Brahm has always had the support of the Sangha at Bodhinyana. </p>
<blockquote><p> To prevent future problems, rules and regulations should be issued so the Thai Sangha can punish the monks overseas who violate th laws and the clergy’s mandates.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Rules and regulations, punishment, violations, and mandates”. This is exactly the opposite of why we became Buddhists, or were attracted to practicing Buddhism, in the first place. We are so, so far from the Dhamma of acceptance, forgiveness, and letting go.</p>
<blockquote><p>    Phra Kru Sudhamprachote said many Thai Buddhists in Perth are unhappy with Aj Brahm and are trying to find way to get him out the temple. But this is up to the people, WPP cannot do anything to support this action.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thai people are like people anywhere – diverse and varied. WPP and the Thai Sangha officials do not have a monopoly of what Thai people want or believe. There are, quite probably, some Thais in Perth who do not like the bhikkhuni ordination. There are certainly many who are fully supportive. </p>
<p>But the claim that WPP can do nothing about the actions of the Thai community in Perth is untrue. In fact, a senior monk from WPP has been ringing his contacts among the Thai people in Perth to urge them to act to have Ajahn Brahm removed. There is no chance that this covert undermining of Ajahn Brahm will succeed. The Perth community is a strong and multi-cultural one. </p>
<p>If this movement gains any momentum, what we may see is the development of a Thai temple in Perth separate from Bodhinyana. It’ll become like every other Thai temple: a place for Thais to go, speak their language, perform their rituals, and be reminded of home. Then they’ll realize that their children are completely alien in this environment, and go to Bodhinayana asking the monks to help teach their children.</p>
<blockquote><p>    Given that the Bhikkhuni ordination and temple ownership problems have greatly troubled the Thai Buddhists in Australia, a committee should be set up to investigate land ownership and temple mismanagement at Bodhinyana in order to return the land and temple to the Thai Buddhists and to ensure that the temple management is in line with Dhamma Vinaya.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you cast your mind back, at the meeting when Ajahn Brahm was expelled from WPP, one of the first reactions was to claim that Bodhinyana should be ‘reclaimed’ by the Thai people. This was immediately dismissed by Ajahn Nyanadhammo, who told the assembly that the monastery was owned by the BSWA and WPP had no jurisdiction over it. At the time I assumed that this claim was just a loose remark by an angry monk; but now it is endorsed by the official committee.</p>
<p>WPP wants to take over Bodhinyana in the name of ‘Thai Buddhism’. This is not without precedent. Daen Maha Monkhon in Kanchanaburi was developed as a stunning, successful center by a charismatic upasika; then last year some monks came and tried to claim the land and take it away from the women. In Vietnam there have similar conflicts; once the monastery is built the government takes over.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this is what’s happening here. The Thai monks have seen how successful and prosperous the BSWA has become. Success always breed envy. They believe that Ajahn Brahm is leading the community in the wrong direction; they want to go there, pull it back in line, and keep the women in their place – the kitchen. Then they will end up with a glistening, prestigious prize: one of the best developed Dhamma centers in the West, with plenty of land and places for Thai monks to come and stay.</p>
<p>Of course, this scenario is sheer fantasy. The BSWA has been such a success precisely because it has engaged with the reality of the lives and needs of people living in Perth, and has not blindly instantiated a model from overseas.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing for now will be to see how the other Western Ajahns react – and even more so, what about the junior monks and nuns, and those considering ordination. How do they feel entering such an environment? If these things had been happening when I was new to all this, I would have run a million miles. After a long slow drift towards conservatism, reactionary politics, and sexist institutionalization, now there’s a rapid and dramatic lurch to the extremes.</p>
<p>In the statement from the WAM and elsewhere, the Western Ajahns have been at pains to claim that their system is a slow and consensual one, and that deliberation and discussion must proceed any move. Clearly this is not how things are going on. They need to start acknowledging this reality. If WPP is really as consensual as they claim, then they must accept full responsibility for these attacks and views. If it is not consensual, then they need to stop hiding behind this smokescreen and admit that there simply is no way that bhikkhuni ordination could have been reasonably pursued within WPP circles.</p>
