    <p>Last Friday (the 13th!) Ajahn Brahm sent an email to the western Ajahns, once more explaining his acts, and very generously suggesting that they hold an Act of Forgiveness. Previously, I put up an excerpt from this email. Doing this was my idea, and Ajahn Brahm gave his permission. Later, however, he reconsidered, and thinking that the message was really just a private gesture of friendship, he asked me to take it down. So I’ve done that. </p>
<p>I’ll leave this post up for the next week for the sake of the kind people who have posted comments. In a week I’ll delete the post entirely. If you want your comment to be saved, please copy it to another appropriate blog posting.</p>
