    <p>Two great pieces of news for all of you sutta fans out there.</p>
<p>First, the first part the long-awaited translation of the Madhyama Agama has been released. This translation was sponsored by the Numata Foundation, with principle translators Ven Analayo and Rod Bucknell, and also Marcus Bingenheimer. It consists of the first 71 suttas (out of 222). This is a historic event, and constitutes the first ever translation of a major early Buddhist collection from Chinese into English. </p>
<p>Moreover, the translation has been done by a highly qualified team, and I have no doubt it will serve to establish a “canonical” method of translation of early Buddhist texts from Chinese, much as the work of Venerables Ñāṇamoli and Bodhi has with the Pali texts. </p>
<p>As a monk I am not supposed to tell people what to do with their money, but I can drop hints. So here’s a hint: <a href="http://www.bdkamerica.org/default.aspx?mpid=30&amp;productid=115&amp;languageid=1" target="_blank">go here and buy this book</a>. Is that subtle enough? We’ve ordered some copies for Bodhinyana, and can’t wait to see them. So far the book is released in hard copy only; but this is one book you will want to have on your shelves. Numata does a nice hardback, clean and well-produced. Typically they release their translations in pdf form a few years after the original publication.</p>
<p>The second great news: Wisdom Publications has launched their new website. This includes selections from Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translations. You can access them through <a href="http://www.wisdompubs.org/collections/wisdom-academics?f[0]=field_collection%253Aparents_all%3A32" target="_blank">here</a>. If you haven’t started with the suttas yet, this is your best introduction. </p>
