    <p>I’ve been away on retreat for the past couple of weeks. I’m just catching up on things and will find some time for blogging in the next little while, I hope.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I just noticed what is a sad day for the web: John Bullitt has announced he will retire from Access to Insight. He has built this site, mostly on his own so I understand, for 20 years, and it has always been the default home for Sutta translations on the web. Now he’s retiring and the site will not be developed further. It will remain solely as a static record, but no additions will be made. </p>
<p>I still remember the first day I saw the internet. It was at my sister’s office, <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/preview#!data=!1m8!1m3!1d3!2d115.844641!3d-31.954049!2m2!1f328.27!2f89.53!4f89.85!2m7!1e1!2m2!1s1PYZaD_GeQevmETaHN5rDw!2e0!5m2!1s1PYZaD_GeQevmETaHN5rDw!2e0&amp;fid=5" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>She showed me this thing called the “internet”. I asked if we could find any Buddhist suttas, and we immediately came across Access to Insight, and found some suttas there. I was blown away to think that the Buddha’s words could be found anywhere, by anyone! </p>
<p>I don’t know how many people have visited the site, or had the same experience. But it must be millions by now. It shows what an amazing thing can be done by the vision and energy of someone who truly loves the Dhamma. Congratulations to John for his remarkable achievement. </p>
