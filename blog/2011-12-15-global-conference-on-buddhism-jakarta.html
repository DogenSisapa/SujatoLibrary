    <p>The <a href="http://www.buddhistfellowship.or.id/">Buddhist Fellowship of Indonesia</a> has just hosted a <a href="http://www.7thgcb.com/">Global Conference on Buddhism</a> in Jakarta. Sadhu to all the wonderful people who helped make it happen. I hope to write some more on it when I get some time. Also, if anyone has photos, please send them to me so I can post them. </p>
<p>But for now, I just wanted to mention this amazing charity, under the auspices of the BFI, called Pintu Belajar. They do wonderful work in helping poor and underpriveliged children in Indonesia to get an education. <a href="http://www.pintubelajar.com/">Check out their website</a>, and do help if you can!</p>
