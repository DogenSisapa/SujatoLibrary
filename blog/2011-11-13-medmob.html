    <p>The MedMob has happened. At 11am on 11/11/11, around 300 randoms gathered in a park above the Sydney Opera House. We came, we sat, we ommed.</p>
<p>I loved the simplicity and purity of it. No message, no ideology. Just people sitting in peace together.</p>
<p>Muchos kudos to Sam and the other organizers. It takes a lot of work to make something so effortless.</p>
<p>The plan is to keep it going, with monthly sits. Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>O and BTW if someone has photos or video, please leave a link in the comments.</p>
