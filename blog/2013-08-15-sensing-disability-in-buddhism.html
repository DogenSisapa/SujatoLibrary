    <p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Please see below the upcoming forum regarding Buddhism and disabilities. If you are in Sydney, take the chance to go along and learn something about the relation between Buddhism and disability.</p>
<h2>Sensing Disability in Buddhism: A Reading Against the Grain</h2>
<p>Australasian Association of Buddhist Studies Seminar Series<br/>
Tuesday, 27 August 2013<br/>
5.30pm – 7.00pm<br/>
N208, Woolley Building, University of Sydney.</p>
<p>Popular Buddhist narratives and iconography abounds with images of bad physicians who become blind or disfigured monks, lepers who put the Buddha in trouble, menstruating nuns who shame the Sangha and a perfect Tathāgatha who embodies the 32 marks of moral perfection. “Dwarf” Arahants, overworked doctors, Vedic notions of pollution and Buddha’s chronic illnesses are often left out of the picture. This presentation will explore themes surrounding constitutional, legal and normative paradigms of inclusion and exclusion embodied in and enforced by Buddhist hermeneutics of the body, karmic multi-life commentaries and hegemonic readings of the Vinaya.</p>
<p>In the first section of my presentation, I will discuss the ideal of moral or virtuous bodies in Buddhism, including the Buddha’s body. It will present contradictions and disruptions in selected Karmic multi-life narratives in the Dhammapada Atthakatha and Thera Apadana. These inter-textual inconsistencies will be contrasted with Buddhist concepts of inter-subjectivity and multi-conditional embodiment in Suttas like Sukkamala Sutta, Upajjhatthana Sutta, Sivaka Sutta and Girimananda Sutta. This section also explores how resorting to explanatory frameworks of multi-life karmic causality to understand exceptional bodies and events can lead to karmic social hierarchies and marginality. This has significant implications for Buddhist ethics in contemporary society.</p>
<p>In the second half of my presentation, I will examine codes relating to bodies “out of order” in the Vinaya; particularly Mahavagga 1.39 – Mahavagga 1.71 and its attendant commentaries and sub-commentaries. I will shed light on how textual modalities of differentiation, notification, prioritization and ranking are adopted to create an elusive monastic ideal of embodied virtue in relation to exterior embodiments (‘deformed’, criminal, female, intersex etc.) which are negated or granted provisional subjectivity. Drawing on narratives of a “dwarf” Arahant, a serial killer and celebrity monks on youtube, this presentation will highlight how such provisional subjectivity both affirms and disrupts karmic and monastic normative ideals.</p>
