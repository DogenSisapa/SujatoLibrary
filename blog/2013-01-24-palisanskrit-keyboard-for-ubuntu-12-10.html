    <p>Note: The following instructions are out of date. Please see this thread: <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/insert-pali-and-sanskrit-characters-with-diacritical-marks-on-discourse-and-operating-systems/311/" rel="nofollow">https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/insert-pali-and-sanskrit-characters-with-diacritical-marks-on-discourse-and-operating-systems/311/</a></p>
<p>A few years ago Galia Shy (Mahacitta) designed a method for <a href="http://santifm.org/santi/2010/04/23/how-to-install-pali-keyboard-for-ubuntu-2/" target="_blank">easily inserting Pali/Sanskrit special characters in Ubuntu</a>. Since then Ubuntu has changed a few things, and the old instructions do not work. I have revised the instructions to work with a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10. (It may work with 12.04, but I havenâ€™t tested it).</p>
<p>You can download the file and instructions from <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2akdbV6bsaaaFA2RnJxSWdJQkU/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if this works for you. Needless to say, no guarantees!</p>
