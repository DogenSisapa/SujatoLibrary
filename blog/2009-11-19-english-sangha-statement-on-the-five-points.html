    <h1>English Sangha statement on the five&nbsp;points</h1>

    <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/english-sangha-statement-on-the-five-points/">https://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/english-sangha-statement-on-the-five-points/</a></p>
    <p>Here we have it: the <a href="http://www.forestsangha.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=382&amp;Itemid=8">official statement from the English Sangha on the controversial Five Points</a>, which officially subjugate the nuns to the monks. You heard about it first on this blog: before the Perth bhikkhuni ordination, this topic was unknown in the wider community. I heard about it, asked for information, and got none. I heard ‘leaked’ information, blogged it, and then got some more accurate information so I could correct a few mistakes in the first version. An unconventional way of operating; but at least it got results. While the English bhikkhus had always said they would make the Five Points public, there was no sign of any movement until the cat was well out of the bag.</p>
<p>Please read the document carefully. I think you’ll find that, while the authors (unknown) obviously have a very different attitude to these things than I do, the document essentially confirms the <a href="http://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-five-points/">criticisms that I have made in this blog</a>, and those which have been <a href="http://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/voice-of-uk-siladhara-on-the-experience-of-the-5-points/">expressed</a> by some of the siladharas.</p>
<p>I upload a copy here in case the link to the Forest Sangha website breaks.</p>
