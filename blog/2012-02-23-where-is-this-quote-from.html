    <p>Since you’ve all been so helpful finding Pali chanting, i wondered whether anyone might be able to help me with something else. I’m looking for the source for this quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>Buddhist or not Buddhist, I have examined every one of the great religious systems of the world, and in none of them have I found anything to surpass, in beauty and comprehensiveness, the Noble Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha. I am content to shape my life according to that path.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is attributed to TW Rhys Davids, the pioneering English indologist, in K Sri Dhammananda’s <em>Buddhism in the Eyes of the Intellectuals</em>. And it certainly sounds like him. But nowhere can I find where it comes from; the usual suspects (Google, Wikipedia) have been no help. I presume it will be in one of his books or essays on Buddhism, and we don’t have these here at Santi. So any ideas?</p>
