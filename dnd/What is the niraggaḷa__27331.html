 This is following my rather speculative ideas about the sammapasa:

  The suttas mention a group of Vedic sacrficies that were condemned by the Buddha as being especially violent. These include the human sacrifice, horse sacrifice, sammāpāsa, vājapeya, and niraggaḷa. 
I’m trying to figure out exactly what these mean. 
Sammāpāsa is not a regular name of a Vedic sacrifice. The Pali commentaries explain it as a sacrifice held after the “throwing” (pāsa) of a “peg” (samma). They say this is held at the Sarasvati river. This detail is confirmed in the Brahmanical side,…

 <em>
  Niraggaḷa

 means “unbarred, unrestricted”. The Buddha used it as an epithet of a mendicant who has become free from the five lower fetters (

 ). He adopted it from the brahmins, where it was the name of a sacrifice. However it is not a regular or well-defined name, so the exact sense is uncertain.
</p>
<p>
 In “Additions to the Study of the Niraggaḷa, etc.” (Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute LIII, nos. 1–4. (1972): 195–199) Thite shows that
 <em>
  niraggaḷa
 </em>
 is used in a few different ways.
</p>
<p>
 One passage of the Mahābhārata describes it as a sacrifice of the sap of all trees, and Thite regards this as the original meaning.
</p>
<p>
 But a prominent sense is the form of horse sacrifice when the horse wanders without restriction for a year, otherwise known as the “universal sacrifice” (
 <em>
  sarvamedha
 </em>
 ). This sense is given in the Pali commentaries as well as the Mahābhārata and Vāyupurāṇa. It seems likely this is the meaning in the Pali texts.
</p>
<p>
 If these identifications are correct, then all five of the rituals mentioned in the Brahmanadhammikasutta (Snp 2.7) were cruel rites that demanded the slaughter of men or beasts in order to establish royal authority over territory. As a reward for the religious sanctification of temporal authority, the presiding brahmin priests would receive a handsome reward (
 <em>
  dakkhina
 </em>
 ).
