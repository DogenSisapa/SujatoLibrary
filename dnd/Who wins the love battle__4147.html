  <h1>Who wins the love battle?</h1>

  <p>
 In the left corner we have reigning champion Brahmā, the Lord God Most High, after whom the very idea of the
 <em>
  brahmavihāras
 </em>
 is named. In the left corner, a radical new upstart, the Buddha, ready to lay a serious kindness smackdown on God Himself.
</p>
<p>
 But there’s a twist: in MN 55, Jīvaka says that he knows that God must be full of love, for he sees how the Buddha is full of love. It’s a draw! And a touching moment of interreligious harmony.
</p>
<p>
 But hang on: does that really make sense? The Buddha is the witness for the fact that Brahma has love?
</p>
<p>
 Let’s see the Pali. Jivaka says to the Buddha:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante: ‘brahmā mettāvihārī’ti. Taṃ me idaṃ, bhante, bhagavā sakkhidiṭṭho; bhagavā hi, bhante, mettāvihārī”ti
  </em>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Ven Bodhi’s translation, which is more or less in line with those of Horner and Chalmers, says:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  I have heard this, venerable sir, ‘Brahmā abides in loving-kindness.’ Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my visible witness to that; for the Blessed One abides in loving kindness.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 In fact the syntax of this is not entirely clear, as noted by Ven Ñāṇatusita in unpublished notes on this passage, although I don’t follow his suggestion there. (He reads
 <em>
  me
 </em>
 as dative, whereas I think it should be instrumental; see
 <em>
  yena
 </em>
 in the passage cited next.)
</p>
<p>
 Surely, however, this passages answers to passages such as DN 13:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   “Kiṃ pana, vāseṭṭha, atthi koci tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ ekabrāhmaṇopi, yena brahmā sakkhidiṭṭho”ti? “No hidaṃ, bho gotama”.
  </em>
  <br/>
  “But Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single one of the tevijja brahmins who has seen Brahmā with his own eyes?” “No, Master Gotama.”
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here is one of the key differences between the Buddha’s teaching and the brahmins’: it relies on direct experience, not the authority of tradition. Even if there is some insight underlying the brahmanical tradition, the brahmins alive today have no experience of it.
</p>
<p>
 This is what Jīvaka is referring to when he says he has “heard” that Brahmā has love: it is a belief passed down in the oral scriptures.
</p>
<p>
 The point of the passage, it seems to me, is that Jivaka has merely
 <em>
  heard
 </em>
 that Brahma has love, but he now
 <em>
  sees with his own eyes
 </em>
 that the Buddha
 <em>
  truly
 </em>
 has love. It is an example of the epistemological challenge of experience vs. tradition.
</p>
<p>
 In this reading we take
 <em>
  hi
 </em>
 in an emphatic sense, rather than as inferential. Accounting for the opening phrase
 <em>
  taṃ me idaṃ
 </em>
 is more difficult. I suggest that this is a fairly rare example of the so-called “
 <a href="http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Textual-Studies/Syntax-of-the-Cases/02-Accusative.htm#toc13">
  accusative of relation
 </a>
 ”, used in a similar sense to the more common locative
 <em>
  tatra …
 </em>
 . So we could render it something like “concerning that”, “in regards to that matter”, etc. But such idioms tend to be heavy handed, and we can achieve a similar effect more economically with “now”.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante: ‘brahmā mettāvihārī’ti. Taṃ me idaṃ, bhante, bhagavā sakkhidiṭṭho; bhagavā hi, bhante, mettāvihārī”ti
  </em>
  <br/>
  Sir, I have heard that Brahmā abides in love. Now, I’ve seen the Buddha with my own eyes, and it is the Buddha who truly abides in love.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 So it seems we have a winner, after all. Rather than equating the love of the Buddha and Brahmā, the point of the passage is that a real, living, demonstration of love in action is much better than an abstract ideal of love that lives only in the scriptures.
