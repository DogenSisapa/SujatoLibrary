 In MN 36 and MN 37 we meet the memorable figure of Saccaka, a renowned debater who boasts of trouncing the Buddha in debate. Needless to say, things don’t go quite as he planned.
</p>
<p>
 His name is given as
 <em>
  saccaka nigaṇṭhaputta
 </em>
 . This is translated variously as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Saccaka, the Nigaṇṭha’s son (Bodhi)
 </li>
 <li>
  Saccaka, son of the Jain (woman) (Chalmers)
 </li>
 <li>
  Saccaka, the son of Jains (Horner)
 </li>
 <li>
  Saccaka, a Nigantha (Jain) (Thanissaro)
 </li>
 <li>
  Saccaka, the son of the Nigaṇṭhas (Analayo, from the Chinese at SA 110)
 </li>
 <li>
  the Nigaṇṭha Saccaka (Malalasekera, Dictionary of Pali Proper Names)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 The commentary says that he was born of Jain parents, hence his name. Initially I was sceptical of this, thinking that the suffix
 <em>
  -putta
 </em>
 was being used in its pleonastic sense, i.e. simply “a Jain”.
</p>
<p>
 However, elsewhere the term
 <em>
  nigaṇṭha
 </em>
 is always used of Jain ascetics, while
 <em>
  nigaṇṭhasāvaka
 </em>
 is used for lay Jain followers. This is the only place that uses
 <em>
  nigaṇṭhaputta
 </em>
 . Of course it might just be an odd idiom, but it suggests it applies to Saccaka personally, which would support the commentary.
</p>
<p>
 So the first question that arises is, was Saccaka actually a Jain? In the dialogues with the Buddha, Saccaka uses arguments that are fairly generally applicable to the ascetic culture of the time, and doesn’t specifically invoke Jain ideas. It is true, he does invoke the virtue of self-mortification, but this was not unique to the Jains; and in doing so, he mentions ascetics other than Mahāvīra, the Jain leader. Decisively, at the end of MN 36 he speaks critically of Mahāvīra just as he does other ascetics. Clearly, he was not a Jain.
</p>
<p>
 The second question is, was he an ascetic? At the beginning of MN 35 he is described as a renowned debater, as
 <em>
  sādhusammata
 </em>
 (“regarded as holy”). However, he is never referred to with any of the epithets specifically reserved for ascetics. And at the end of MN 35, he offers the Buddha and the Sangha a meal, which is of course a service restricted solely to the lay community. So he is not an ascetic.
</p>
<p>
 It seems, then, that the commentary must be correct, and he is known as
 <em>
  nigaṇṭhaputta
 </em>
 because of his parents. For the sake of clarity, therefore, it is best to translate something like:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Saccaka, the son of Jain parents
 </p>
