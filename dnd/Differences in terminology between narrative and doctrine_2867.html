 One of the basic, but alas often ignored, distinctions in the EBTs is that between the doctrinal material and the narrative background. It is of course the doctrine, things things actually ascribed to the Buddha or his disciples, that is the critical part. The overwhelming evidence of comparative studies shows that the narratives were treated much more loosely than the doctrinal passages.

 One sign that the narratives are, on the whole, from a different and later strata is the distinctive vocabulary they employ. Remember, most suttas have very little narrative, so there is not necessarily that much in total, but it is in fact quite a large percentage of the text. I haven’t seen a comprehensive study of this, so I thought I’d just jot down some notes as I notice things. They’re not necessarily 100% consistent, just general tendencies.

 All these cases, so far at least, evidence a consistent trend. The terms found in the narrative are more formal or Sanskritic, while the language of the doctrinal passages is more colloquial, informal, and local.

  Narrative:
  <em>
   bhikkhavo
  </em>
 </li>
 <li>
  Doctrine:
  <em>
   bhikkhave
  </em>
 </li>
 <li>
  Note:
  <em>
   Bhikkhave
  </em>
  is the eastern or Magadhan form, and is more colloquial. It’s by far the most common such form in the Pali, and is likely to be a term closely associated with the Buddha’s personal speech. Outside of narrative,
  <em>
   bhikkhavo
  </em>
  seems to be used exclusively in verse.

  <em>

  <em>
   bhante

  is more colloquial Pali.

  Narrative:
  <em>

  Doctrine:
  <em>
   Kassapa

  Note:
  <em>
   Mahākassapa
  </em>
  is a more elevated term. The same pattern is seen for Moggallāna (and other Mahās?).
