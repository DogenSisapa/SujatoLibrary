 Here I will collect some miscellaneous notes on translating the 32 marks of a great man (
 <em>
  mahāpurisa lakkhaṇa
 </em>
 ). Generally I will try to translate in a naturalistic way as long as this does no violence to the text. I only discuss problematic terms here, most of them are quite straightforward.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <em>
   Suppatiṭṭhitapāda
  </em>
  : refers to a die that always lands “right side up” (AN 3.118), to planting the feet firmly (AN 9.35), or more metaphorically to something being well established.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>
   Jālahatthapāda
  </em>
  : often translated as “netted” or “webbed” hands and feet, or interpreted as a network of lines. However the commentary specifically says it does not mean this (
  <em>
   na cammena paṭibaddhaaṅgulantaro
  </em>
  ), but rather refers to the fact that the four fingers and all five toes are of equal length. In the surprisingly moving tale of the Buddha’s horse Kanthaka at Vv 81, the bodhisatta is said to have stroked his horse’s flanks with his hands “soft,
  <em>
   jāli
  </em>
  , and copper-nailed”. Now, soft (
  <em>
   mudu
  </em>
  ) is the previous one of the 32 marks, while copper-nailed is, as the commentary to that passage says, one of the 80 minor marks (added in later days). This, incidentally, shows that PTS dictionary is wrong here to argue that
  <em>
   jāli
  </em>
  itself refers to the nails, which is a misreading of this passage. In any case, this confirms that
  <em>
   jāli
  </em>
  refers to something that could be felt while being stroked, which would rule out webbing.
  <em>
   Jāla
  </em>
  is commonly used in the sense of something that grasps or ensnares; craving is called
  <em>
   jālinī
  </em>
  . I think that, like
  <em>
   suppatiṭṭhitapāda
  </em>
  , it refers more to a manner of using the hands rather than a physical feature as such. It suggests hands that are graceful and gentle, which grasp things securely but without force, like a net moving in water. Admittedly, this reading is less apt when applied to the feet. In DN 30, this sign is said to be the outcome of practicing the four kinds of inclusiveness. This agrees with the idea that his hands are soft and hold things well; people don’t slip through his fingers. This would, of course, apply to webbing as well.

<ul>
 <li>
  <em>
   kuṇḍalāvaṭṭāni dakkhiṇāvaṭṭakajātāni
  </em>
  : Usually translated as hairs that “turn right”. But we don’t use right and left for circular motion, but clockwise or anticlockwise. Here, not only is clockwise the symbolically suitable motion, it is correct, as seen in the motion of the
  <em>
   padakkhiṇa
  </em>
  , i.e. circling someone with your right side towards them, which is a clockwise motion.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>
   Samavaṭṭakkhandha
  </em>
  : Ven Bodhi has “neck and shoulders are even”, which seems incorrect. The
  <em>
   khanda
  </em>
  is the torso, and
  <em>
   samavaṭṭa
  </em>
  means “evenly-rolled” i.e. cylindrical. This much is supported by the commentary, which says his torso is like a well-rolled golden drum (
  <em>
   suvaṭṭitasuvaṇṇāliṅgasadiso khandho hoti
  </em>
  ). It adds a description saying that, unlike birds like herons or cranes, when the Buddha speaks there is no sign of the Adam’s apple. But this seems unlikely, as so far as I know
  <em>
   khanda
  </em>
  is never used in this sense. It just means that his torso is well-rounded.
