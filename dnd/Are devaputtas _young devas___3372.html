  <h1>Are devaputtas “young devas”?</h1>

 In Ven Bodhi’s translations he renders the term
 <em>
  devaputta
 </em>
 as “young deva”. I don’t find this adequate; firstly because
 <em>
  deva
 </em>
 is not a translation. What’s wrong with “god” or “deity” (although the latter is best reserved for
 <em>
  devatā
 </em>
 )? Moreover, I can‘t see any reason for thinking that
 <em>
  devaputtas
 </em>
 are young.
</p>
<p>
 In the introduction to
 <em>
  Connected Discourses
 </em>
 Ven Bodhi admits that there is no hard and fast distinction between
 <em>
  devata
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  devaputta
 </em>
 , as sometimes one and the same individual is referred to by both terms. More cogently, in the Devaputta Samyutta we meet, among others, the Sun and Moon, who aren’t “young” by any standard. Other deities are also no spring chickens; for example, we meet the
 <em>
  devaputta
 </em>
 Ghaṭikāra, who has been in that station since the time of the last Buddha.
</p>
<p>
 In fact, I can’t find any justification in the canon or commentary for why
 <em>
  devaputta
 </em>
 refers to a young god. The commentary doesn’t distinguish
 <em>
  devaputtas
 </em>
 as “young”. True, it says they are born “in the lap of the gods”, but this is about the mode of generation, not about their age. It explains how they can be “sons” (and
 <em>
  devadhītā
 </em>
 are “daughters”) even though they are not born from a womb.
</p>
<p>
 The distinctive features of
 <em>
  devaputtas
 </em>
 identified by the commentary are, firstly, that
 <em>
  devaputtas
 </em>
 are male while
 <em>
  devadhītās
 </em>
 are female. And secondly, that, in contrast with the more generic
 <em>
  devatā
 </em>
 , they have names (which is true as a generalization). Neither of these have anything to do with their age.
</p>
<p>
 It seems to me that
 <em>
  deva
 </em>
 vs.
 <em>
  devaputta
 </em>
 is a distinction in search of a difference. It’s better to translate them both as “god”, with “goddess” for
 <em>
  devī
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  devadhītā
 </em>
 .
