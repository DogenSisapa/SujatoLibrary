 As is well known, the Pali term
 <em>
  jhāyati
 </em>
 , better known in noun form as
 <em>
  jhāna
 </em>
 , draws upon two distinct roots, which take the same form in Pali. The two roots are to “burn, glow, illuminate” and to “consider, ponder, ruminate”.
</p>
<p>
 It seems that the term
 <em>
  samādhi
 </em>
 , which is usually synonymous with
 <em>
  jhāna
 </em>
 in the EBTs, also draws on dual roots. This seems so obvious that I am surprised that I am surprised; probably someone has written about this; heck, I’ve probably done it myself!
</p>
<p>
 The PTS dict acknowledges two main senses for the verb form
 <em>
  samādahati
 </em>
 , to gather or assemble, and to kindle a fire. The first sense is clearly the primary one in the context of meditation. However the second sense is well attested in Bhikkhu Pacittiya 56, which lays down an offence for a monk who lights a fire. Unfortunately, the rule analysis does not define
 <em>
  samādahati
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 In the past I have thought—and taught—that here it meant to “assemble” or put together the materials for the fire. However, this is incorrect, so I apologize to those I have misled.
 <img alt=":pray:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="media/Samādhi is both a gathering and a fire_01.png" title=":pray:" width="20"/>
 The rule states that it is an offence to
 <em>
  samādahati
 </em>
 a fire, and this must be “kindling” the flame, rather than merely assembling the materials.
</p>
<p>
 While this dual sense is correctly acknowledged in the dictionary and translations, the dictionary gives only one etymology, to
 <em>
  ādahati
 </em>
 <sup>
  1
 </sup>
 , which itself derives from
 <em>
  dahati
 </em>
 <sup>
  1
 </sup>
 . Here the root is similar in meaning to the derived form, meaning to “put” or “place”.
</p>
<p>
 However there is also a term
 <em>
  dahati
 </em>
 <sup>
  2
 </sup>
 , to burn. This must be the sense that is prominent in the “kindling” of fire. Thus
 <em>
  samādahati
 </em>
 should be acknowledged to have two roots, or perhaps to be two distinct words. However in
 <em>
  samādhi
 </em>
 the two senses would seem to be combined, in agreement with the very widespread use of imagery of light and radiance in the context of deep meditation.
</p>
<p>
 The text that triggered this inquiry was SN 7.9. There, the Buddha is criticizing a brahmin for thinking that purity comes from lighting the sacred flame.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mā brāhmaṇa dāru samādahāno
  </em>
  <br/>
  When you’re kindling the firewood, brahmin,
  <br/>
  <em>
   Suddhiṃ amaññi bahiddhā hi etaṃ;
  </em>
  <br/>
  don’t imagine this is purity, for it’s just an external.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This is of course part of the standard Buddhist critique of meaningless rituals. The ritual persists today; brahmanical priests still perform the agnihotra.

 Sorry, my bad, that’s

<p>
 Moving on! In the next verse, the Buddha says:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Hitvā ahaṃ brāhmaṇa dārudāhaṃ
  </em>
  <br/>
  I’ve given up kindling firewood, brahmin,
  <br/>
  <em>
   Ajjhattamevujjalayāmi jotiṃ
  </em>
  <br/>
  now I just light the inner flame.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here
 <em>
  dāhaṁ
 </em>
 must belong to
 <em>
  dahati
 </em>
 <sup>
  2
 </sup>
 , and since this echoes the previous verse,
 <em>
  samādahati
 </em>
 there must draw on the same root. The next lines emphasize this even more:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Niccagginī niccasamāhitatto,
  </em>
  <br/>
  Always blazing, always converged (=“akindle”),
  <br/>
  <em>
   Arahaṃ ahaṃ brahmacariyaṃ carāmi.
  </em>
  <br/>
  I am a perfected one living the spiritual life.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Wow, so being on fire is directly paralleled with being in samādhi!
</p>
<p>
 As so often in verse, the exact sense is a little ambiguous. In some cases, the past participle
 <em>
  samāhita
 </em>
 is said to have the sense of “comprised of” rather than
 <em>
  samādhi
 </em>
 in the sense of deep meditation, although I can’t find strong support for this. (See AN 8.59, SN 2.6) It is possible, I guess, that the term here means something like “always steady in oneself”. If it does refer to actual samādhi, it must be somewhat of a poetic expression, because the Buddha was obviously not literally in samādhi all the time.
</p>
<p>
 Still, regardless of the exact interpretation, the connection between
 <em>
  samādahati
 </em>
 and fire is clear and strong. This is a rather interesting counterpoint to the whole
 <em>
  nibbāna
 </em>
 as the going out of the flame thing. And another interesting question: I wonder whether
 <em>
  samādhi
 </em>
 in the Hindu tradition retains the “fire” sense at all?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
 Incidentally, in the same sutta we have a clear allusion to one of my favorite Upanishadic dialogues, Brihadaranyaka 4.3.
</p>
<p>
 In SN 7.9, after the previously-discussed verses, the Buddha goes on to develop a set of correlations between a brahmin’s ritual equipment and various ethical qualities. Such point-by-point analogies are highly characteristic of the Upanishads, as they endeavor to evolve a higher spiritual sense of the Vedic rituals. By itself, however, this is not really remarkable enough to conclude there’s an Upanishadic parallel. However, we find the Buddha saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Attā sudanto purisassa joti
  </em>
  <br/>
  The well-tamed self is the light of a man.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 This is a very close analogue with the Brihadaranyaka, where King Janaka asks:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   yājñavalkya, kiṁ-jyotir ayam puruṣa iti
  </em>
  <br/>
  Yājñavalkya, what is the light of a man?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Given that the terms for “light” and “man” here both have multiple possible synonyms, their concurrence here is unlikely to be an accident. The text enters into a
 <a href="https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=Lsp18ZvstrcC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=yajnavalkya+fire+self&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pmz8yxt6pD&amp;sig=3D2OB7i9Y_PgvP-QHUtjJ8NjK3k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">
  playful dialogue between the king and the sage
 </a>
 , until finally Yājñavalkya is made to divulge that the self (
 <em>
  ātman
 </em>
 ) is a man’s true light. As to what that self is:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   yo’yaṁ vijñānamayaḥ prāṇeṣu, hṛdy antarjyotiḥ puruṣaḥ
  </em>
  <br/>
  It is that man made of consciousness among the vital energies/senses, the inner light of the heart.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 As always, while the language is clearly related, the Buddha avoids the metaphysical implications, preferring a practical and ethical teaching.
