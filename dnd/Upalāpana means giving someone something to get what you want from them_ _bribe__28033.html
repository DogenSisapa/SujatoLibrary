 When the Buddha had outlined the 7 principles of non-decline to Vassakāra, he responded that the Vajjians could indeed not be overcome except by
 <em>
  upalāpana
 </em>
 or by “sowing dissension”. The sense of
 <em>
  upalāpana
 </em>
 has not been clearly recognized by translators. Bodhi has “treachery”; Walshe has “propaganda”; Brahmali (in different contexts) has “befriends”, “supports”, “wins over”; Thanissaro has “befriends”; I had “diplomacy” as does Ānandajoti.
</p>
<p>
 As for dictionaries, Digital Pāḷi Dictionary has “persuading; coaxing; cajoling; buttering up”, to which Cone’s dictionary adds the sense “wins over”.
</p>
<p>
 Let’s have a look at some contexts. Here are the relevant Vinaya passages in
 <a class="mention" href="/u/brahmali">
  @Brahmali
 </a>
 ’s translation.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:6.1: Sometime later, in the Great Wood near Vesālī, a certain monk
  <strong>
   befriended
  </strong>
  a female monkey by giving her food. He then had sexual intercourse with her.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 (You might be thinking that the exact meaning of
 <em>
  upalāpana
 </em>
 is the least interesting thing about this passage, but I will ignore that and forge ahead!)
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:1.55: If a monk
  <strong>
   supports
  </strong>
  that novice monastic, or he is attended on by him, lives with him, or shares a sleeping place with him, even though he knows that he has been expelled in this way, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
  <br/>
  …
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Supports
  </strong>
  :
  <br/>
  if he
  <strong>
   supports
  </strong>
  him, saying, “I’ll give him a bowl,” “I’ll give him a robe,” “I’ll recite to him,” or “I’ll test him,” he commits an offense entailing confession.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  pli-tv-kd2:21.2.4: Those monks should treat that learned monk with kindness. They should assist him and
  <strong>
   support
  </strong>
  him, and they should attend on him with bath powder, soap, tooth cleaners, and water for rinsing the mouth.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.26.18: A man
  <strong>
   befriended
  </strong>
  that monk by giving him food. Seeing a customs station, he gave the monk a valuable gem, saying,  “Sir, please take this gem past the customs,”
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.16: Or a bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites from the Sangha—a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the site of a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a mattress, a pillow, a metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, earthenware goods—and uses them to
  <strong>
   win over
  </strong>
  and create a following among householders.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 In the suttas we find:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  sn3.25:4.13: In this royal court there is abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can
  <strong>
   pay off
  </strong>
  an approaching enemy.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 So in all the cases we find the sense of using some kind of material gift in order to win someone over to your side. This might be done in a wholesome way, as for example providing suitable gifts for a senior monk, but in most cases it is a form of manipulating or bribing. In any case we can definitely rule out “treachery”, “propaganda”, or “diplomacy”. “Supporting” and “befriending” are not completely wrong, but I feel there could be a clearer rendering.
</p>
<p>
 The sense from SN 3.25 is particularly relevant, as it shows exactly how a king might “pay off” or “bribe” an enemy.
