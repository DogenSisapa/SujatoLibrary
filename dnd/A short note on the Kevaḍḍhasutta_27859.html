 I have been annotating the Kevaḍḍhasutta, and I find I am adopting most of the interpretation proposed by

Introduction
A wide range of opinions has long surrounded two innocent Pali words: viññāṇa anidassana. They are translated variously, as ‘consciousness that is without feature / signless / invisible / non-manifesting / makes no showing / can not be characterized’, et cetera. This variety already indicates that their meaning is somewhat obscure. This obscurity has, however, not stopped interpreters from giving the words…

</aside>
<p>
 It’s not without problems, but gives a clean interpretive lens.
</p>
<p>
 Just adding a couple of details here. To justify separating the first two lines as a distinct question, there is the verb
 <em>
  gādhati
 </em>
 at the end, but equally important is that this merely rephrases the original question.
</p>
<p>
 The next lines, with the derived material properties of long, short, coarse, fine, beautiful and ugly, are used in two contexts elsewhere:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  snp3.9:45.1: a list of things that ought not be stolen
 </li>
 <li>
  snp1.8:4.3: a list of sentient beings (texts omits beautiful and ugly, but they obviously apply)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Thus I think the dhammic sense is that these are aspects of the material world that are
 <em>
  desirable
 </em>
 (or undesirable), i.e. not just “raw” materiality (the four elements) but the aspects of “form” that we actually get attached to.
</p>
<p>
 I agree with including
 <em>
  anantaṁ
 </em>
 in the first line of the question, but it then means we conjoin “invisible” and “radiant all round”. So either:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  we choose one of the other meanings of
  <em>
   pabhaṁ
  </em>
  (“giving up” or “ford”)
 </li>
 <li>
  or the line expresses a paradox: it is invisible since those of lesser attainment cannot grasp it, yet it is all-radiant since it lights the path to Nibbana.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 The latter is a nice meaning, and is the sense I am currently accepting, but it’s just an unusual way for the suttas to express themselves.
</p>
<p>
 By the way, when the commentary (which began the whole “consciousness is Nibbana” problem) interprets
 <em>
  pabhaṁ
 </em>
 as “ford”, it is evidently drawing on the meaning of
 <em>
  gādha
 </em>
 , which can indeed mean “ford”.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
 Now, there are a couple of other data points that need mentioning. The term
 <em>
  anidarṣana
 </em>
 appears in the Udānavarga where it has an interesting sense. These are Dhammapada style verses, but have no direct parallels in Pali. In the
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/uv31/san/bernhard?reference=main&amp;highlight=true#uv31.4">
  Cittavarga
 </a>
 we find:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   bhrūṇadheyam idaṁ cittaṁ niḥsāram anidarśanam
  </em>
  <br/>
  This mind is pregnant, coreless, invisible
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here it is clearly describing the ordinary mind and has nothing to do with either Nibbana or advanced meditation. It just means that the mind cannot be seen.
</p>
<p>
 In the Brahmanavarga it appears twice in one six-line verse, which I split here for convenience. Here’s a quick and dirty translation.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   arūpiṇaṁ sadā cittam asāram anidarśanam
  </em>
  <br/>
  The formless, coreless, invisible mind, always
  <br/>
  <em>
   damayitvā hy abhijñāya ye caranti sadā smṛtā
  </em>
  <br/>
  having trained, those who, having directly known [that mind], wander ever mindful,
  <br/>
  <em>
   kṣīṇasaṁyojanā buddhā lokeṣu brāhmaṇā hi te
  </em>
  <br/>
  the Buddhas who have ended fetters, they are the brahmins in the worlds.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here again
 <em>
  anidarśana
 </em>
 clearly refers simply to the ordinary mind, which is understood.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   arūpam anidarśanam anantam asudarśanam
  </em>
  <br/>
  Formless, invisible, infinite, not beautiful,
  <br/>
  <em>
   sūkṣmaṁ padam abhijñāya ye caranti sadā smṛtāḥ
  </em>
  <br/>
  the subtle state, having directly known, those who wander ever mindful,
  <br/>
  <em>
   kṣīṇasaṁyojanā buddhās te loke brāhmaṇā iha
  </em>
  <br/>
  the Buddhas who have ended fetters, they are the brahmins here in the world.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 With the addition of the epithets “infinite” and “formless”, this sounds a lot more like the formless attainments. The “subtle state” would normally be a reference to Nibbana. I’m not really sure what
 <em>
  asudarśanam
 </em>
 is doing here.
</p>
<p>
 I’m not entirely clear what is to be made of these lines. But clearly we do have a sense of
 <em>
  nidarśana
 </em>
 as simply the ordinary mind being “invisible”. The last lines are more reminiscent of the Kevaddha verses, but I don’t know what to make of that. The Udānavarga is probably a later expansion, and it’s possible these lines were adapted from the Kevaddha sutta, rather than being an independent source.
