 While the future tense may be used in a wide variety of ways, I have yet to find a grammar that mentions what in English we refer to as “future perfect tense”. This may well be an oversight of mine, so if anyone does find such a reference, please let me know.

 In any case, I have come across one passage that is an example of future perfect tense in Pali. It’s in MN 81. The Buddha smiles at a certain place, and on being questioned by Ānanda, reveals that the Buddha Kassapa in a past age had sat on this spot. Ānanda invites the Buddha to sit down, saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Ayaṃ bhūmipadeso dvīhi arahantehi sammāsambuddhehi paribhutto bhavissatī
  </em>
  <br/>
  Then this piece of land will have been occupied by two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The use of future tense in combination with the past participle in context must function as a future perfect tense.

 I am sure you will sleep much easier knowing this. You’re welcome!
