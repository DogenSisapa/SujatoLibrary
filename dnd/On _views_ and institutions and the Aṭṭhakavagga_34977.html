 This reflection was prompted by the recent discussions of Bhikkhu Dukil’s new translation of the Arthapada.

 In his thesis he ably summarizes the rather extensive academic discussions of the supposed priority of the Pali Aṭṭhakavagga, which has been often held up as an example of pre-institutional Buddhism that is notably older and more authentic than the bulk of the prose suttas. I don’t agree with this argument, for reasons I outline
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/edition/snp/en/sujato/introduction?lang=en">
  in my introduction to the Suttanipata
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 But one thing about the academic discussions just struck me, kind of loosely associated with my current reading,
 <em>
  The Dawn of Everything
 </em>
 (Graeber and Wengrow). One of the arguments they make is that much modern thinking about early societies stems from Rousseau, who, bereft of any actual experience, imagined a thought experiment of what came to be known as the “noble savage”.
</p>
<p>
 There’s an affinity here with the academic idea of a pristine, pure “original Buddhism” characterized by the lonely sage of the forest, before they become encumbered with monasteries, property, rules, and formalities. I wonder how much of this is a product of the academic imaginaire, as they sit in closed-in offices, filling in budget request forms, managing troublesome students, and wondering about tossing it all in to seek a life of freedom. It’s a relief to think that at least someone has managed to do that.
</p>
<p>
 If you’ve ever been wandering on carika or tudong it truly is a blessed and unique experience. Your senses are alive, your needs are reduced to the most primal. Yet for many, perhaps most, on such wanderings, there is also a sense of relief at arriving at a nice institution, with clean beds, insect-free spaces, easy bathing, and good food. Institutions aren’t all bad.
</p>
<p>
 Now, there is a definite historical process underlying this. It’s obviously true that Buddhism started out as an informal grouping of practitioners, who gradually over time established institutions. We know this because of common sense, but also because this is the story that Buddhists told themselves. It is recounted at length in the Vinaya, especially
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali?lang=en&amp;layout=sidebyside&amp;reference=none&amp;notes=sidenotes&amp;highlight=true&amp;script=latin">
  the first chapter of the Khandhakas
 </a>
 . A similar narrative about general societal evolution of institutions is told in such texts as the Aggaññasutta (DN 27).
</p>
<p>
 The question then is why the Aṭṭhakavagga became a central text in establishing the early history of Buddhism, over the texts that actually talk about that. Well, the real answer is probably simply that the academic world rewards theses that are novel over than those that are obvious.
</p>
<p>
 But what I want to discuss here is the question of views. The Aṭṭhakavagga famously argues against holding “views”, which supposedly contrasts with the mainstream sutta position that we should develop right view. Again, not really discussing this point in general here, but rather, how it relates to institutionalization.
</p>
<p>
 The assumption seems to be that in early days the mendicants were supposed to be free of views, which are seen as dogmatic and leading to conflict. But as institutions grew, there was a need to insist of conformity, the establishment of “right view”.
</p>
<p>
 There’s a huge historical question mark over this whole idea, however. The notion of “no view” has been connected with the Madhyamaka philosophy, which prevails in many circles in Tibetan and east Asian Buddhism, for example, famously among Zen, at least as it has been presented to the West. But East Asian and Central Asian Buddhism was massively institutionalized. Sure, there were iconoclastic outsiders, but the teaching of “no view” is not restricted to them. It’s a mainstream part of the institutional philosophy. In modern times this is the same; we find teachers such as Ajahn Sumedho, influenced by Zen, who emphasizes the idea of “no view”.
</p>
<p>
 If the philosophy of “no view” is associated with iconoclasts, why do we find it so often repeated in the halls of large institutions? Why are they not insisting that everyone follow “right view”?
</p>
<p>
 Long ago, I recall Ven Dhammavuddho of Malaysia remarking that when someone tells you not to read the suttas, just practice, what they are saying is “don’t listen to the Buddha’s view, listen to mine.”
</p>
<p>
 The teaching of “no view” is routinely used to dismiss the thoughts and ideas of students. If they say something, especially some position that disagrees with the teacher, they’ll be kindly urged to not think so much, or be warned of the attachment to views. “No view” in practice often ends up as one view, and that one view is the view of the patriarch who sits on the seat of power.
</p>

 This is the difference between the stopping of thought (MN 20):

   Thought stopping (TS) is a cognitive self-control skill that should be used to counter dysfunctional or distressing thoughts, in hopes of interrupting sequences or chains of problem responses. When used with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), it can act as a distraction, preventing an individual from focusing on their negative thought. Patients can replace a problematic thought with a positive one in order to reduce anxiety and worry. The procedure uses learning principles, such as counte The c...

  <p>
   A thought-terminating cliché (also known as a semantic stop-sign, a thought-stopper, bumper sticker logic, or cliché thinking) is a form of loaded language, often passing as folk wisdom, intended to end an argument and quell cognitive dissonance. Its function is to stop an argument from proceeding further, ending the debate with a cliché rather than a point. Some such clichés are not inherently terminating; they only become so when used to intentionally dismiss dissent or justify fall The term wa...

 Institutions, in fact, work in both ways. They encourage a uniformity of view, and they also encourage “no view”. How they handle and emphasize this varies, of course. But the point is that there’s no real correspondence between the ideas of “no view” = iconoclastic wanderer vs. “right view” = rigid institution.
</p>
<p>
 Authoritarian regimes today also use these two techniques. These days, China is of course focused on a single doctrinaire explanation of history, one that erases facts from the past. And in service of this is scrubs wrong thought from the internet. But it also massively promotes “no thought”. This was brought home to me a couple of years ago, as the COVID lockdowns were being protested. If you searched on Twitter for the Chinese characters for Beijing or Shanghai, you would get an apparently endless stream of messages from lovely young ladies in those cities who were lonely and looking for a partner. Nothing on the riots and protests. Or if there was, it was one message, rapidly swamped by the endless stream of mindless distraction. Don’t think about it, here’s a pretty girl instead!
</p>
<p>
 I’ve been talking about misuse of the ideas of “no view” and “right view”. But that’s a misuse, it’s not the things themselves. Actually they’re fine. Of course there are some things we need to get right, and correct those beliefs we hold that are wrong. And of course there is also a sense in which we must be humble about our thoughts and views, for they are not reality.
</p>
<p>
 The same thing goes for institutions vs the lonely life of a wanderer. Plenty of lonely wanderers do so because they just can’t seem to get along with people. It can be great, but it can also be a way of not facing up to your issues. Same with living in institutions. These things are neither good nor bad, they are just different ways of living.
</p>
<p>
 The Aṭṭhakavagga is about a specific set of concerns, which it addresses in a distinctive literary style. None of that means that it is especially early, or that its message somehow justifies ditching the rest of the Dhamma. By overloading the text with theory, by giving in to the temptation to romanticize, scholarship has managed to obscure what it is actually saying.
