 It was pointed out by Oskar von Hinuber,
 <em>
  The Foundation of the Bhikkhuni Sangha
 </em>
 , pp. 17–19, that several of the terms and ideas unique to bhikkhuni Vinaya are shared with the Jains.

 Such terms include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <em>
   pavattinī
  </em>
  : used for “preceptor”, “mentor” rather than
  <em>
   upajjhāya
  </em>
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>
   vuṭṭhāpana
  </em>
  : used for “ordination” instead of
  <em>
   upasampadā
  </em>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  the period of training for the
  <em>
   sikkhamāna
  </em>
  or “trainee nun”.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 In my
 <em>
  <a href="https://sujato.me/bvs.html">
   Bhikkhuni Vinaya Studies
  </a>
 </em>
 I proposed that such influence was due to the prominence in the early Sangha of nuns converted from the pre-existing Jain community. This would parallel the conversion of the first five monks in the
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali?lang=en&amp;layout=linebyline&amp;reference=none&amp;notes=none&amp;highlight=false&amp;script=latin">
  early conversion narrative of the first Khandhaka
 </a>
 . A prominent example of such conversion is Bhadda Kundalakesa, who, I have argued, may well be the actual first bhikkhuni.
</p>
<p>
 While annotating SN 1.42 and SN 1.47 I came across what seems to be the only occurrence of the word
 <em>
  upassaya
 </em>
 in Buddhism to refer to monastic quarters in general. Normally this word is restricted solely to the bhikkhuni quarters.
</p>
<p>
 Now, formerly I had assumed that the
 <em>
  upa-
 </em>
 here suggested that such quarters were adjacent to the monks’ monastery. But this was mistaken, as it turns out it is a regular term for monastic quarters for both monks and nuns in Jainism.
</p>
<p>
 You can see from the examples below that basically all the textual sources for the Sanskrit term
 <em>
  upaśraya
 </em>
 in the sense “monastic quarters” are Jain. Incidentally, passages such as
 <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/jainism/book/acaranga-sutra/d/doc424445.html">
  this one
 </a>
 that reference cutting grass inside the
 <em>
  upaśraya
 </em>
 show that it must mean “compound” rather than “hut”.

 As to why the nuns’ community used Jain terms while the monks moved away from them, perhaps the answer is also given in the early conversion narrative. After ordaining the five (Jain or Jainish) ascetics, the Buddha swiftly ordained a thousand Brahmanical ascetics. We don’t have to take all the details of this narrative as literally historical in order to acknowledge that the presence of large numbers of formerly Brahmanical ascetics would influence the community’s language.
</p>
<p>
 Now, clearly all the renunciate orders of ancient India were related and influenced each other. But if it is true that the bhikkhunis were more influenced by the Jains, and the bhikkhus were more influenced by the Brahmins, then this might be a fruitful lens through which to reflect on the different approaches to Vinaya in the two Sanghas.
