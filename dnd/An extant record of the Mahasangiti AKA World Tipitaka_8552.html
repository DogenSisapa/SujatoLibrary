 One of the main reasons why, back in 2012, we started serving our own texts at SC was the disappearance of the World Tipitaka site. Previously we had linked to them as the best source of the Pali texts. But their whole network all of a sudden went dark, our links died, and there remained just fragments. Luckily we were able to restore the text from a copy made by Ven Yuttadhammo.

 I just happened to come across one of their remaining sites. They put some information on a Google sites website, so it’s still there. It actually has a good deal of background on the project, so it’s of interest to anyone who wants to understand how our digital texts came to be. Some of the information is top quality, for example a sophisticated guide to Pali pronunciation.

 The main website is partially captured at
 <a href="http://archive.org">
  archive.org
 </a>
 . However so far as I can see the texts themselves are not captured, or at least not all of them. It seems that from about September 2011 the sites went dark. These are the most recent snapshots of various properties.
