  <h1>Did Māra actually initiate Brahmā and his assembly?</h1>

 In yet another entry in what is becoming an extensive series of essays on MN 49, may I draw your attention to the usage of a single verb,
 <em>
  upanesi
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 This verb is used twice in the text. In both cases, it is spoken in a dialogue with Māra while he is possessing a member of Brahmā’s assembly; once by Māra, and once by the Buddha. In both cases the context—that is, Māra’s speech—is similar, warning the Buddha to back off his attack on existence itself, lest he suffer some dire fate. Alternatively, if he follows Brahmā, he will be rewarded. It would therefore seem very likely that the word is used in the same sense.
</p>
<p>
 However, so far as I have seen, every translation renders them completely differently. In addition, even the
 <em>
  Critical Pali Dictionary
 </em>
 and Cone’s
 <em>
  Dictionary of Pali
 </em>
 seem to miss this connection.
</p>
<p>
 In the first passage, Māra finishes his speech by saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Nanu tvaṃ, bhikkhu, passasi brahmaparisaṃ sannipatitan’ti?
  </em>
  <br/>
  Do you not see the assembly of Brahmā gathered here?”
  <br/>
  <em>
   Iti kho maṃ, bhikkhave, māro pāpimā brahmaparisaṃ upanesi.
  </em>
  <br/>
  And that is how Māra the Wicked held the assembly of Brahmā up to me as example.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here I translate
 <em>
  upanesi
 </em>
 following the commentary. Various translators say that Māra “conducted me to the company of Brahmā” (Horner), “directed my attention to Brahma’s assembly” (Thanissaro), or “called to witness the Brahmā’s assembly” (Bodhi).
</p>
<p>
 There is then a long passage, after which Māra once more possesses a member of the assembly, and says:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   sace kho tvaṃ, mārisa, evaṃ pajānāsi, sace tvaṃ evaṃ anubuddho, mā sāvake upanesi, mā pabbajite
  </em>
  <br/>
  If such is your understanding, good sir, do not
  <em>
   upanesi
  </em>
  your disciples or those gone forth.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here the commentary is of no help, since it gives a purely verbal gloss. CPD and DoP, however, take
 <em>
  upanesi
 </em>
 here in the sense of “initiate”, an allusion to the ancient Brahmanical ritual of
 <em>
  upanayana
 </em>
 , where someone, typically a young boy, is inducted into their spiritual life, somewhat comparable to Confirmation in Catholicism.

   Upanayana (Sanskrit: उपनयनम्, romanized: Upanayanam, lit. 'initiation') is a Hindu educational sacrament, one of the traditional saṃskāras or rites of passage that marked the acceptance of a student by a preceptor, such as a guru or acharya, and an individual's initiation into a school in Hinduism. Some traditions consider the ceremony as a spiritual rebirth for the child or future dvija, twice born. It signifies the acquisition of the knowledge of God and the start of a new and disciplined li

<p>
 The various translators have here “communicate” (Horner), “lead” (Thanissaro), or “guide” (Bodhi). While it isn’t obvious how the two usages are related, surely they must be connected somehow.
</p>
<p>
 A crucial question is whether this could, in fact, be used in the sense of the
 <em>
  upanayana
 </em>
 ceremony. There seems to be some doubt as to the antiquity of this ceremony, and it seems unlikely it is being literally invoked here. Rather, it’s probably part of a range of everyday meanings that gradually became codified as a specific ritual. In that sense, it is usually taken to mean “led close to” as in introduced to a mentor; but the word is also used for the beasts led to the sacrifice—make of that what you will!
</p>
<p>
 I tend to agree with the commentarial reading of the first passage here, and I think this can be applied in the second case, too. Rather than meaning “initiated”, it means “hold up as example”. This agrees nicely with the rest of the passage.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   sace kho tvaṃ, mārisa, evaṃ pajānāsi, sace tvaṃ evaṃ anubuddho, mā sāvake upanesi, mā pabbajite
  </em>
  <br/>
  If such is your understanding, good sir, do not hold it up as an example for disciples or those gone forth! Do not teach Dhamma to disciples or those gone forth! Do not build expectations regarding disciples or those gone forth!
