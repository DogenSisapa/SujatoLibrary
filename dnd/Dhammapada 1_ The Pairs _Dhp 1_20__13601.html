 Intention is the forerunner of all things;
 <br/>
 intention’s their master, they’re made by intention.
 <br/>
 If with a corrupt intention
 <br/>
 you speak or act,
 <br/>
 suffering follows you,
 <br/>
 like a wheel the ox’s foot.
</p>
<p>
 Intention is the forerunner of all things;
 <br/>
 intention’s their master, they’re made by intention.
 <br/>
 If with a pure intention
 <br/>
 you speak or act,
 <br/>
 happiness follows you
 <br/>
 like a shadow that never leaves.

 “He abused me, he hit me!
 <br/>
 He beat me, he took from me!”
 <br/>
 Those who cling to hate like this
 <br/>
 never settle their enmity.
</p>
<p>
 “He abused me, he hit me!
 <br/>
 He beat me, he took from me!”
 <br/>
 Those who never cling to hate
 <br/>
 always settle their enmity.
</p>
<p>
 For enmity in this world
 <br/>
 is never settled by enmity.
 <br/>
 It’s only settled by love:
 <br/>
 this is an ancient law.
</p>
<p>
 Others don’t understand
 <br/>
 that we should restrain ourselves right away.
 <br/>
 But the clever ones understand;
 <br/>
 that’s why they settle their quarrels.
</p>
<p>
 One who meditates on the beautiful,
 <br/>
 their faculties unrestrained,
 <br/>
 immoderate in eating,
 <br/>
 lazy, lacking energy:
 <br/>
 Māra strikes them down
 <br/>
 like the wind a feeble tree.
</p>
<p>
 One who meditates on the ugly,
 <br/>
 their faculties well-restrained,
 <br/>
 eating in moderation,
 <br/>
 faithful and energetic:
 <br/>
 Māra cannot strike them down,
 <br/>
 like the wind a rocky mountain.
</p>
<p>
 The impure one
 <br/>
 who would wear the ochre robe
 <br/>
 bereft of taming and truth:
 <br/>
 they are not worthy of the ochre robe.
</p>
<p>
 Whoever has rejected impurities,
 <br/>
 steady in ethics,
 <br/>
 possessing taming and truth,
 <br/>
 they are truly worthy of the ochre robe.
</p>
<p>
 Thinking the inessential is essential,
 <br/>
 seeing the essential as inessential;
 <br/>
 they don’t realize the essential—
 <br/>
 for wrong thoughts are their pasture.
</p>
<p>
 Having known the essential as essential,
 <br/>
 and the inessential as inessential;
 <br/>
 they realize the essential,
 <br/>
 for right thoughts are their pasture.
</p>
<p>
 Just as rain seeps into
 <br/>
 a poorly roofed house,
 <br/>
 lust seeps into
 <br/>
 an undeveloped mind.
</p>
<p>
 Just as rain doesn’t seep into
 <br/>
 a well roofed house,
 <br/>
 lust doesn’t seep into
 <br/>
 a well developed mind.
</p>
<p>
 Here they grieve, hereafter they grieve,
 <br/>
 a doer of bad grieves in both places.
 <br/>
 They grieve and fret,
 <br/>
 seeing their own corrupt deeds.
</p>
<p>
 Here they rejoice, hereafter they rejoice,
 <br/>
 a doer of good rejoices in both places.
 <br/>
 They rejoice and celebrate,
 <br/>
 seeing their own pure deeds.
</p>
<p>
 Here they’re tormented, hereafter they’re tormented,
 <br/>
 a doer of bad is tormented in both places.
 <br/>
 They’re tormented thinking of the bad things they’ve done,
 <br/>
 and when gone to a bad place, they’re tormented all the more.
</p>
<p>
 Here they delight, hereafter they delight,
 <br/>
 a doer of good delights in both places.
 <br/>
 They delight thinking of the good things they’ve done,
 <br/>
 and when gone to a good place, they delight all the more.
</p>
<p>
 Much though they may recite scripture,
 <br/>
 if a negligent person does not act accordingly,
 <br/>
 then like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others,
 <br/>
 they share none of the blessings of the ascetic life.
</p>
<p>
 Little though they may recite scripture,
 <br/>
 if they live in line with the teachings,
 <br/>
 having given up greed, hate, and delusion,
 <br/>
 with deep understanding and mind well freed,
 <br/>
 not grasping to this world or the next,
 <br/>
 they share all the blessings of the ascetic life.
