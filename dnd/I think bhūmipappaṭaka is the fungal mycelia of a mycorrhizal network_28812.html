  <p>
 In the Aggaññasutta  (DN 27) there is a series of vegetations that evolve as foodstuff for beings. It’s not always obvious what exactly they are.
</p>
<p>
 After the disappearance of the first food, “earth nectar”, there appears
 <em>
  bhūmipappaṭaka
 </em>
 .
 <em>
  Bhūmi
 </em>
 is “earth, ground”, while
 <em>
  pappaṭaka
 </em>
 is said in Pali dictionaries to be a water plant or a mushroom.
</p>
<p>
 The Sanskrit parallels here have
 <a href="https://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&amp;q=parpa%E1%B9%ADa&amp;lang=sans&amp;action=Search">
  <em>
   parpaṭaka
  </em>
 </a>
 , which is the same in both the Hybrid Sanskrit Mahavastu and the Mulasarvativada Vinaya in classical Sanskrit. The dominant sense is a “thin cake” (“papadam”), but as so often with Sanskrit there are several other senses too.
</p>
<p>
 The reading here is unclear, as some Pali manuscripts have
 <em>
  pappāṭika
 </em>
 . There is another Sanskrit word
 <a href="https://sanskritdictionary.com/prap%C4%81%E1%B9%ADik%C4%81/147435/1">
  <em>
   prapāṭikā
  </em>
 </a>
 in the sense of a young sprout or tendril, while the Pali
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/define/papa%E1%B9%ADik%C4%81">
  <em>
   papaṭikā
  </em>
 </a>
 (or
 <em>
  pappaṭikā
 </em>
 ) is said to mean either “bark” or “sprout”.
</p>
<p>
 The unifying sense of “thin cake” and “bark” would be “crust”, and perhaps that is the sense here, a layer or crust formed on the earth.
</p>
<p>
 But there is another reference at
 <a>
  pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.5
 </a>
 , where Moggallāna suggests that, to alleviate famine, the monks might eat the
 <em>
  pappaṭakojaṁ
 </em>
 (“
 <em>
  pappaṭaka
 </em>
 -nutrition”) under the earth. It seems hard to reconcile this with the sense “crust”, and more likely it is a kind of tendril that lives underground.
</p>
<p>
 In DN 27, they are compared to mushrooms. I think these are the fungal mycelia of a mycorrhizal network. Such fungi spread like tendrils underground, sometimes appearing above the surface, and facilitate sharing of nutrients and information between organisms.

  <p>
   Mycelium (plural mycelia) is a root-like structure of a fungus consisting of a mass of branching, thread-like hyphae. Fungal colonies composed of mycelium are found in and on soil and many other substrates. A typical single spore germinates into a monokaryotic mycelium, which cannot reproduce sexually; when two compatible monokaryotic mycelia join and form a dikaryotic mycelium, that mycelium may form fruiting bodies such as mushrooms. A mycelium may be minute, forming a colony that is t Through ...

  <p>
   A mycorrhizal network (also known as a common mycorrhizal network or CMN) is an underground network found in forests and other plant communities, created by the hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi joining with plant roots. This network connects individual plants together and transfers water, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients and minerals between participants. Several studies have demonstrated that mycorrhizal networks can transport carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, water, defense com The formation and na...

 I will probably translate it, then, as “ground-fungus”.

 you currently have “sprouts”, what do you think?
