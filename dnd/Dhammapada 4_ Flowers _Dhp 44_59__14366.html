<p>
 Who shall explore this land,
 <br/>
 and the Yama realm with its gods?
 <br/>
 Who shall examine the well-taught word of truth,
 <br/>
 as an expert examines a flower?
</p>
<p>
 A trainee shall explore this land,
 <br/>
 and the Yama realm with its gods.
 <br/>
 A trainee shall examine the well-taught word of truth,
 <br/>
 as an expert examines a flower.
</p>
<p>
 Knowing this body is like foam,
 <br/>
 realizing that it’s all just a mirage,
 <br/>
 and cutting off Māra’s blossoming,
 <br/>
 vanish from the King of Death.
</p>
<p>
 As a mighty flood sweeps off a sleeping village,
 <br/>
 death steals away a man
 <br/>
 even as he gathers flowers,
 <br/>
 his mind caught up in them.
</p>
<p>
 The terminator gains control of the man
 <br/>
 who has not had his fill of pleasures,
 <br/>
 even as he gathers flowers,
 <br/>
 his mind caught up in them.
</p>
<p>
 A bee takes the nectar
 <br/>
 and moves on, doing no damage
 <br/>
 to the flower’s beauty and fragrance;
 <br/>
 and that’s how a sage should walk in the village.
</p>
<p>
 Don’t find fault with others,
 <br/>
 with what they’ve done or left undone.
 <br/>
 You should only watch yourself,
 <br/>
 what you’ve done or left undone.
</p>
<p>
 Just like a glorious flower
 <br/>
 that’s colorful but lacks fragrance;
 <br/>
 eloquent speech is fruitless
 <br/>
 for one who does not act on it.
</p>
<p>
 Just like a glorious flower
 <br/>
 that’s both colorful and fragrant,
 <br/>
 eloquent speech is fruitful
 <br/>
 for one who acts on it.
</p>
<p>
 Just as one would create many garlands
 <br/>
 from a heap of flowers,
 <br/>
 when a person has come to be born,
 <br/>
 they should do many skillful things.
</p>
<p>
 The fragrance of flowers doesn’t spread upwind,
 <br/>
 nor sandalwood, pinwheel, or jasmine;
 <br/>
 but the fragrance of the good spreads upwind;
 <br/>
 a good person’s virtue spreads in every direction.
</p>
<p>
 Among all the fragrances
 <br/>
 of sandalwood or pinwheel
 <br/>
 or lotus or jasmine,
 <br/>
 the fragrance of virtue is supreme.
</p>
<p>
 Faint is the fragrance
 <br/>
 of sandal or pinwheel;
 <br/>
 but the fragrance of the virtuous
 <br/>
 floats to the highest gods.
</p>
<p>
 For those accomplished in ethics,
 <br/>
 meditating diligently,
 <br/>
 freed through the highest knowledge,
 <br/>
 Māra cannot find their path.
</p>
<p>
 From a forsaken heap
 <br/>
 discarded on the highway,
 <br/>
 a lotus might blossom,
 <br/>
 fragrant and delightful.
</p>
<p>
 So too, among the forsaken,
 <br/>
 a disciple of the perfect Buddha
 <br/>
 outshines with their wisdom
 <br/>
 the blind ordinary folk.
