 The famous, or perhaps notorious, MN 57 depicts two friends, Seniya and Puṇṇa, both of whom have undertaken as a spiritual practice to behave like an animal: a dog for Seniya, a cow for Puṇṇa. The Buddha was not particularly enthusiastic about their life choices.
</p>
<p>
 Most translations—with the notable except of the oldest, that by Chalmers—describe both of them as “ascetics”. However, while Seniya is said to be an
 <em>

 </em>
 —that is, a naked ascetic—Puṇṇa is nowhere described in this way.
</p>
<p>
 The differences are not just in their appellations. While Seniya’s dog-like behavior is described—he curls up to sit down like a dog, and eats food thrown on the ground—nothing similar is said of Puṇṇa. In fact, throughout he behaves entirely normally. It seems he may well have been less diligent in his observance.
</p>
<p>
 At the end of the discourse, Seniya receives the going forth, where it is confirmed that he was an ordained follower of another sect. Puṇṇa, on the other hand, merely asks for the going forth, at which time he says, as is normal, that he wishes to be regarded as a lay follower (
 <em>
  upāsaka
 </em>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 So it seems that Puṇṇa was not, in fact, an ascetic, but a lay practitioner who had undertaken such a vow, observing it a fairly relaxed way. It is interesting to see the blurring of lines between renunciants and householders, and to see that in ancient India such bizarre spiritual practices may have been undertaken while still living at home.
