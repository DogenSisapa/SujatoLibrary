  <h1>A love song for the Buddha</h1>

 Among all the diverse teachings in the early Buddhist texts, there is only one love song. That there is even one is a remarkable thing; and that it’s central conceit is so bold is even more remarkable.
</p>
<p>
 You can read the story on DN 21, but here I’d like to present my translation of Pañcasikha’s verses. Normally I take a very prosaic approach to translating verse: if I can convey the meaning in a way that is not too offensive to the ear, I’m happy. But given the extraordinary context, I thought it would be apt to sprinkle a little rhyme and rhythm in the lyrics. Enjoy!
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  My lady Suriyavaccasā, oh my Sunshine—
  <br/>
  I pay homage to your father Timbaru,
  <br/>
  through whom was born a lady so fine,
  <br/>
  to fill me with a joy I never knew.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  As sweet as a breeze to one who’s sweating,
  <br/>
  or when thirsty, a sweet and cooling drink,
  <br/>
  so dear is your shining beauty to me,
  <br/>
  just like the teaching is to arahants!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Like a cure when you’re struck by fever dire,
  <br/>
  or food to ease the hunger pain,
  <br/>
  come on, darling, please put out my fire,
  <br/>
  quench me like water on a flame.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  As elephants burning in the heat of summer,
  <br/>
  sink down in a lotus pond to rest,
  <br/>
  so cool, full of petals and of pollen—
  <br/>
  that’s how I would plunge into your breast.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Like elephants bursting bonds in rutting season,
  <br/>
  beating off the pricks of lance and pikes—
  <br/>
  I just don’t understand what is the reason
  <br/>
  I’m so crazy for your shapely thighs!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  For you, my heart is full of passion,
  <br/>
  I’m in an altered state of mind.
  <br/>
  There is no going back, I’m just not able,
  <br/>
  I’m like a fish that’s hooked up on the line.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Come on, my darling, hold me, fair of thighs!
  <br/>
  Embrace me, with your so bashful eyes!
  <br/>
  Take me in your arms, my lovely lady,
  <br/>
  that’s all I’d ever want or could desire.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Ah, then my desire was such a small thing,
  <br/>
  my sweet, with your curling wavy hair;
  <br/>
  but now, like to arahants an offering,
  <br/>
  it’s grown so very much from there.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Whatever the merit I have forged
  <br/>
  by giving to such perfected beings—
  <br/>
  may that, my altogether gorgeous,
  <br/>
  ripen in togetherness with you!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Whatever the merit I have forged
  <br/>
  in the wide open circle of this earth—
  <br/>
  may that, my altogether gorgeous,
  <br/>
  ripen in togetherness with you!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Absorbed, the Sakyan meditates,
  <br/>
  at one, self-controlled, and ever mindful,
  <br/>
  the sage aims right at the deathless state—
  <br/>
  like me, oh my Sunshine, aiming for you!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  And just like the sage would be rejoicing,
  <br/>
  were he to awaken to the truth,
  <br/>
  so I’d be rejoicing, lady,
  <br/>
  were I to end up as one with you.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  If Sakka were to grant me just one wish,
  <br/>
  as Lord of the holy Thirty-Three,
  <br/>
  my darling, you’re the only one I’d wish for,
  <br/>
  so strong is the love for you from me.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Like a freshly blossoming
  <i>
   sal
  </i>
  tree
  <br/>
  is your father, my lady oh so wise.
  <br/>
  I pay homage to him, bowing down humbly,
  <br/>
  to he whose daughter is of such a kind.
 </p>
