 MN 76:53.5 has the Buddha criticizing the Ājīvakas with the mysterious phrase
 <em>
  puttamatāya puttā
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The commentary to that passage says:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  So it seems that having heard that teaching the Ājīvakas were considered dead, or they seemed so. This is the meaning of that: Ājīvakas were called “dead”, their mother had dead sons, thus Ājīvakas were called “sons of she whose sons are dead”.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Now, the reading
 <em>
  puttamatāya
 </em>
 is probably feminine, and can be a number of cases, but most obviously genitive.
</p>
<p>
 I just came across a similar phrase in Ja 79, in reference to a brutal bandit:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Athāgamā puttahatāya putto
  </em>
  <br/>
  Then came the son of she whose son is dead.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The reading is
 <em>
  hata
 </em>
 rather than
 <em>
  mata
 </em>
 , but both mean “dead”, so this is not consequential. The commentary here is different, however (mostly Anandajoti’s trans):
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Puttahatāya putto
   </strong>
   ti hataputtāya putto nillajjo, ti attho. Chinnahirottappassa hi mātā nāma natthi, iti so tassā jīvanto pi, hataputtaṭṭhāne tiṭṭhatī ti, hataputtāya putto nāma hoti.
  </em>
  <br/>
  The shameless son was (son of she whose son is dead; reversal of compound), this is the meaning. Having cut off conscience and prudence he has nothing called a mother, thus though she still lives, he remains in the state of being a dead son. so he is called the son of she whose son is dead.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 While the wording is different, the sense of the explanation is the same. In both cases we are to take
 <em>
  puttamatāya
 </em>
 or
 <em>
  puttahatāya
 </em>
 as feminine in the sense of “she whose sons are dead”. The sense is “worthless, shameless”, and it might be compared to English expressions like, “is that how your mother raised you?”
</p>
<p>
 We might translate idiomatically as “reprobate” or similar, or keep the striking image of the original.
