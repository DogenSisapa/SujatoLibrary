 <em>
  Evaṁ sampadamidaṁ
 </em>
 is a reasonably common idiom in the Suttas, yet many translations seem to miss the point.
</p>
<p>
 It is consistently used in contexts where someone acts ill-advisedly and must face the consequences. It doesn’t mean just “so it is”, or “in such a case”. Rather,
 <em>
  sampadā
 </em>
 means “consequence”, and the idiom means “such is the consequence”, or more idiomatically, “that’s what you get”. IB Horner got it right, rendering it “this results thus”. And in Ven Bodhi’s more recent update of the Majjhima, he similarly uses “befall”.
</p>
<p>
 For example, see the stock passage where monks don’t understand a discourse from the Buddha, then go to find some other monk to explain it to them, eg. AN 10.172:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Evaṃsampadamidaṃ āyasmantānaṃ satthari sammukhībhūte …
  </em>
  <br/>
  Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you passed him by, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 In other cases, it refers to the more dire consequences of slandering the Buddha (MN 12):
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   taṃ, sāriputta, vācaṃ appahāya taṃ cittaṃ appahāya taṃ diṭṭhiṃ appaṭinissajjitvā yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye.
  </em>
  <br/>
  Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Seyyathāpi, sāriputta, bhikkhu sīlasampanno samādhisampanno paññāsampanno diṭṭheva dhamme aññaṃ ārādheyya, evaṃ sampadamidaṃ, sāriputta, vadāmi.
  </em>
  <br/>
  Just as a mendicant accomplished in ethics, convergence, and wisdom would reach enlightenment in this very life, such is the consequence, I say.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 There’s a more complex idiom at MN 49:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Please, dear sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā. If you do, then the consequence for you will be like that of a person who’s approached by Lady Luck but wards her off with a staff, or someone who shoves away the ground as they fall down the chasm into hell.
