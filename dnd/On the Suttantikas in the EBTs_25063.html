 Just a brief note here, since the topic of the ancient Sautrāntikas came up.

  The Pali term
  <em>
   suttantika
  </em>
  occurs a few times in the Vinaya
 </a>
 , where it means “those bhikkhus who recite the Suttas”.
</p>

  Dabba Mallaputta assigned lodgings for them all together
 </a>
 , so that they could “recite the Suttas together” (
 <em>
  te aññamaññaṁ suttantaṁ saṅgāyissantī
 </em>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Similar arrangements were made for “those who have memorized the Vinaya” (
 <em>
  vinayadharā
 </em>
 ), for Dhamma teachers, for meditators, and even for those who wanted to waste their time with gossip and nonsense.
</p>
<p>
 There’s no mention of those who recited the Abhidhammapitaka, because it didn’t yet exist.
</p>
<p>
 Note that the word
 <em>
  suttantika
 </em>
 also occurs in the Abhidhamma in a slightly different sense. There it means the terms discussed as found in the Suttas, as opposed to the specifically Abhidhamma meanings.
