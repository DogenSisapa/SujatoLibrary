 Better than a thousand
 <br/>
 meaningless sayings
 <br/>
 is a single meaningful saying,
 <br/>
 hearing which brings you peace.

<p>
 Better than a thousand

 <br/>
 is a single meaningful verse,
 <br/>
 hearing which brings you peace.
</p>
<p>
 Better than reciting
 <br/>
 a hundred meaningless verses
 <br/>
 is a single saying of Dhamma,
 <br/>
 hearing which brings you peace.
 <br/>
 The supreme conqueror is
 <br/>
 not he who conquers a million men in battle,
 <br/>
 but he who conquers a single man:
 <br/>
 himself.
</p>
<p>
 It is surely better to conquer oneself
 <br/>
 than all those other folk.
 <br/>
 When a person has tamed themselves,
 <br/>
 always living restrained,
 <br/>
 no god nor fairy,
 <br/>
 nor Māra nor Brahmā,
 <br/>
 can undo the victory
 <br/>
 of such a one.
</p>
<p>
 Rather than a thousand-fold sacrifice,
 <br/>
 every month for a hundred years,
 <br/>
 it’s better to honor for a single moment
 <br/>
 one who has developed themselves.
 <br/>
 That offering is better
 <br/>
 than the hundred year sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
 Rather than serve the sacred flame
 <br/>
 in the forest for a hundred years,
 <br/>
 it’s better to honor for a single moment
 <br/>
 one who has developed themselves.
 <br/>
 That offering is better
 <br/>
 than the hundred year sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
 Whatever sacrifice or offering in the world
 <br/>
 a seeker of merit may make for a year,
 <br/>
 none of it is worth a quarter
 <br/>
 of bowing to the upright.
</p>
<p>
 For one who has the regular custom
 <br/>
 of bowing to the elders,
 <br/>
 four blessings grow:
 <br/>
 lifespan, beauty, happiness, and strength.
</p>
<p>
 Better to live a single day
 <br/>
 ethical and absorbed in meditation
 <br/>
 than to live a hundred years
 <br/>
 unethical and lacking immersion.
</p>
<p>
 Better to live a single day
 <br/>
 wise and absorbed in meditation
 <br/>
 than to live a hundred years
 <br/>
 witless and lacking immersion.
</p>
<p>
 Better to live a single day
 <br/>
 energetic and strong,
 <br/>
 than to live a hundred years
 <br/>
 lazy and lacking energy.
</p>
<p>
 Better to live a single day
 <br/>
 seeing rise and fall
 <br/>
 than to live a hundred years
 <br/>
 blind to rise and fall.
</p>
<p>
 Better to live a single day
 <br/>
 seeing the deathless state
 <br/>
 than to live a hundred years
 <br/>
 blind to the deathless state.
</p>
<p>
 Better to live a single day
 <br/>
 seeing the supreme teaching
 <br/>
 than to live a hundred years
 <br/>
 blind to the supreme teaching.
