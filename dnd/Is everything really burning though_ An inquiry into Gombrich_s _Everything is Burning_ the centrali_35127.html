 To answer my own question, obviously yes. And obviously, I’m trolling you with this title.

 We know all is burning from the Buddha’s third discourse, where he famously told a group of Brahmanical ascetics that “all”, i.e. the eye and so on, the “all” of experience, is burning. And that this imagery is “central” is affirmed by the fact that the Buddha’s ultimate word for his spiritual goal is Nibbana, the going-out of the flame.
</p>
<p>
 While the centrality of fire imagery is quite obvious in the Suttas, in his article
 <a href="https://archive.org/details/WhatTheBuddhaThought/page/n125/mode/2up?view=theater">
  <em>
   Everything is Burning: the centrality of fire in the Buddha’s thought
  </em>
 </a>
 , Richard Gombrich makes the case that it is still more pervasive than is usually thought. As I looked into this, I was reminded of other arguments on fire, Ven Thanissaro’s
 <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/going-out-like-fire-quenched/32466">
  <em>
   Mind Like Fire Unbound
  </em>
 </a>
 and Joanna Jurewicz’s
 <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/is-dependent-origination-a-parody-of-vedic-cosmology/30841">
  <em>
   Playing With Fire
  </em>
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 All three essays share much in common. They take a fresh and creative look at imagery and meaning in the Pali suttas, illuminating them with details from Vedic practices and beliefs of fire worship.
</p>
<p>
 For myself, I love this approach. I think it is super-important to be creative and literary in understanding the early texts, and it’s equally important to establish what we do on the basis of the culture within which the Buddha lived and with which he engaged.
</p>
<p>
 Nonetheless, just because the approach is good does not mean the results are persuasive. And in the cases of both Thanissaro and Jurewicz, a closer look—by myself and Ven Sunyo respectively—reveals that neither author really makes their case (see the links above). Is Gombrich more successful? Let’s see!
</p>
<p>
 One point in Gombrich’s favor is that his thesis is more modest. Where Thanissaro wanted to argue for a quasi-eternalist idea of Nibbana, and Jurewicz wanted to see dependent origination as a narrative dialectic, Gombrich wants to highlight the metaphorical significance of certain doctrinal terms, which lends a richer meaning to certain passages. He doesn’t argue that traditional approaches are wrong per se, but thinks they have lost a significant dimension of meaning, since they were no longer concerned with answering the Vedic culture that the Buddha was speaking to. He is doubtless right in this, and I have pointed out many other similar cases.
</p>
<p>
 For me as a translator, the key issue is really this. We can take a variety of terms and ideas and understand them either in the “traditional” way or in the “fiery” way. Granted, both dimensions are present. But which is primary? Are these things fundamentally based in fire imagery? Or is fire imagery simply a way of illustrating them in certain contexts? I have to be cautious about accepting changes in such basic terms, as they are always massively ramified. I don’t have the luxury of simply selecting a few passages and playing around with ideas, because I have to actively apply those readings right across the canon.
</p>

 </a>
 the three fires
</h2>
<p>
 Gomrich starts out with the Buddha’s third sermon, “all is burning”. And he reminds us that this is spoken in a strongly “fiery” context: the Buddha is converting a group of fire-worshipping ascetics. He speaks of the three fires: greed, hate, and delusion, because of which the whole field of experience based on the six senses is burning.
</p>
<p>
 He then points out that the Buddha also spoke of three fires in another context, where they are specifically compared, again when talking with a brahmin, with the three fires maintained by a brahmin householder (AN 7.47). There, the Buddha speaks of both the three fires that should be put out, as well as a more conventional set of three that transform the Brahmanical fires into an ethical teaching (see also DN 33:1.10.71, Iti 93).
</p>
<p>
 Clearly the three defilements can be illustrated with the imagery of fire in a direct response to Vedic teachings. But there doesn’t seem to be anything particularly fiery about greed, hate, and delusion as such. The Buddha used all kinds of imagery to describe the defilements in various ways. These three, for example, are more commonly known as “unskilful roots” (
 <em>
  akusalamūla
 </em>
 , eg. MN 9:5.2).
</p>
<p>
 Thus it seems that the three defilements are primarily thought of as psychological properties which may be illustrated with a variety of imagery. In responding to brahmins, the idea of the three fires can be invoked.

 the going out of the flame
</h2>
<p>
 As we know, Nibbana means “extinguishment” and directly draws on the imagery of a flame going out.
</p>
<p>
 There are, in fact, two terms in Pali that appear similar and have a similar meaning, but which draw from different roots.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <em>
   Nibbāna
  </em>
  is from nī + √vā in the sense “depriving of air”, thus starving a fire.
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>
   Nibbuti
  </em>
  is from the root √var,
  <em>
   nirvṛta
  </em>
  in Sanskrit, i.e. to “cover over” or “smother”.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 The similarity of both sound and sense mean that these are usually treated as synonyms.
</p>
<p>
 On page 112, Gombrich distinguishes between them, saying that
 <em>
  nibbuti
 </em>
 has a positive sense of “bliss”. He doesn’t cite any references, however, and I have not been able to trace any such meaning in Sanskrit dictionaries or texts.
</p>
<p>
 The roots of the idea of Nibbana clearly lie in fire imagery and clearly respond to the Vedic context. How
 <em>
  present
 </em>
 , however, is this metaphorical sense? Words are on a constant path of evolution, which typically moves from material and objective senses to more subtle and abstract. To a modern Buddhist today, “Nibbana” doesn’t really immediately evoke the idea of fire, it is just a word for the thing it describes.
</p>
<p>
 When speaking of the goal, the Buddha invoked a wide range of imagery, just as he did for the three defilements. We have “sanctuary”, refuge", freedom", “coolness”, “bliss”, “peace”, and—well,
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn43.14-43/en/sujato?lang=en&amp;layout=plain&amp;reference=none&amp;notes=sidenotes&amp;highlight=true&amp;script=latin">
  see for yourself
 </a>
 . So it seems safe to say that the
 <em>
  idea
 </em>
 of the unconditioned goal can be illustrated by many similes of which fire is just one.
</p>
<p>
 A quick count shows that the term “extinguishment” occurs over 700 times in my translations. Of those occasions, only a few instances specifically invoke the imagery of fire. For the most part, Nibbana is simply treated as a word for the goal.
</p>
<p>
 I think it’s for this reason that some translators render Nibbana as “liberation” or “peace”. They seem to feel that the fire-imagery of the term is relatively subdued in most cases, and the metaphorical underpinnings need not be expressed in translation. Personally, I think the metaphor is more alive than that, which is why I render with “extinguishment”. But I still think that, outside of the passages where it is specifically invoked, the metaphorical charge of Nibbana is secondary and it is mainly just a word for the goal.

 <a class="anchor" href="#graspingfuel-3" name="graspingfuel-3">

 grasping/fuel
</h2>
<p>
 Gombrich points out that
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 means both “grasing, attachment” as well as “fuel”. He is careful to say that the sense of fuel dominates “when the context deals with fire”.
</p>
<p>
 His main text here is SN 12.52, specifically the following passage:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   mahāaggikkhandho purimassa ca upādānassa pariyādānā aññassa ca anupahārā anāhāro nibbāyeyya
  </em>
  <br/>
  As the original fuel (
  <em>
   upādāna
  </em>
  ) is used up and no more is added, the bonfire would be extinguished due to lack of fuel (
  <em>
   āhāra
  </em>
  ).
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Clearly the sense of
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 in this passage is “fuel” (synonymous with
 <em>
  āhāra
 </em>
 , “food”), although we have to take this a little cautiously. Refering back to the PTS dictionary quoted by Gombrich, it says,
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  (lit. that [material] substratum by means of which an active process is kept alive and going), fuel, supply, provision".
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 In other words, even here,
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 is not specifically fiery imagery. Now, in the wider Indic tradition it has the sense “material cause”. For example, the clay is the material cause of the pot, while the work of the potter is the effective cause. Clearly this is the sense that the PTS dictionary is alluding to here. This means that
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 means “material cause” in general, which in this context happens to be the fuel for a fire. The fieriness is derived from context.
</p>
<p>
 Thus the commentary to Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.172 says that the five elements are the
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 of the body, while in 3.2.5 food (
 <em>
  anna
 </em>
 ) is the “material cause”. Nor is this sense confined to Brahmanism, for the commentary to the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 5.39 uses the same term in reference to time.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, in non-Buddhist texts we find
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 used in the sense of “taking up” a new life, just as it is in dependent origination. This is from Śaṅkāra’s comment to Brihadārannyaka Upaniṣad 3.3.1:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  the bodies and organs of the liberated are for ever discarded, while those of the transmigrating are repeatedly taken up (
  <em>
   punarupādānaṁ
  </em>
  ).
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 So far as I have been able to find, the only references to
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 specifically as “fuel” for fire are in Buddhist texts. It seems that the Buddha used this general term in a specific application, which influenced later Buddhists.
</p>
<p>
 In the suttas, fiery imagery occurs a few times (MN 72:19.10, MN 99:17.2). Most interestingly, we have SN 44.9, where the Buddha is talking to a characteristically bewildered Vacchagotta:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  “I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel. It’s like a fire which only burns with fuel, not without fuel. In the same way I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel.”
  <br/>
  “But when a flame is blown away by the wind, what does Mister Gotama say is its fuel then?”
  <br/>
  “At such a time, I say that it’s fueled by wind. For the wind is its fuel then.”
  <br/>
  “But when someone who is attached has laid down this body and has not been reborn in one of the realms, what does Mister Gotama say is their fuel then?”
  <br/>
  “When someone who is attached has laid down this body, Vaccha, and has not been reborn in one of the realms, I say they’re fueled by craving.”
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Now, in this case the fire imagery is obviously prominent, and it practically demands that we render
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 as “fuel”; I fudge it by saying “grasps fuel”.
</p>
<p>
 If we look a little further, we find that exactly the same terms are used in contexts that have nothing to do with fire. At SN 12.56, the Buddha says:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Mendicants, suppose there was a great tree. And its roots going downwards and across all draw the sap upwards. Fed and fuelled by that, the great tree would stand for a long time. In the same way, there are things that fuel grasping …
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 is used with
 <em>
  āhāra
 </em>
 in the sense of “material cause”, just as it is in the context of fire. And the connection with
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 as grasping is exactly the same. Yet fire is conspicuously absent. This confirms that, in Pali as in Sanskrit, the basic sense of
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 in such contexts is “material cause” in general, of which “fuel” for fire is a subset. To keep the metaphor alive, we can use things that “fuel grasping” for
 <em>
  upādānīya
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The primary sense of
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 is as a set of defilements that are the immediate cause of rebirth, or “taking up” a new body in a new life. However, the sense of “material cause” occurs in a few cases in the context of fire.

 <a class="anchor" href="#aggregates-4" name="aggregates-4">

 aggregates
</h2>
<p>
 The Pali closely connects the notions of
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  khandha
 </em>
 , so much so that the latter rarely occurs independently in this sense. Gombrich notes that the word for “bonfire” in SN 12.52 is
 <em>
  mahāaggikkhandha
 </em>
 , literally “great mass of fire”, which connects with the “mass of suffering” in the same sutta.
</p>
<p>
 So far so good, but Gombrich also makes the rather radical suggestion that in the standard compound
 <em>
  upādānakkhandha
 </em>
 , the word
 <em>
  aggi
 </em>
 should be present but was dropped as superfluous, since
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 is already there. I really can’t follow him on this leap, it’s far too much much weight to place on far too slim evidence; or really, no evidence at all.
</p>
<p>
 But let’s consider
 <em>
  upādānakkhandha
 </em>
 and ask what is the primary metaphor here.
</p>
<p>
 Now, there are of course
 <em>
  five
 </em>
 aggregates. Normally, sets of five have as their primary material basis the hand. And one of the tells for this is that groups of five tend to break up into four plus one (rather than say three plus two). For example, in the five faculties, wisdom is the chief, holding the other four together like the ridgepole on a roof. Wisdom is the thumb. In the five aggregates, consciousness plays this role: the other four aggregates are the “ground for consciousness” (SN 22.54).
</p>
<p>
 This suggests that the primary metaphor for the “five” aggregates is the hand, which of course agrees with the most common sense of
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 , to “take up” or “grasp”.
</p>
<p>
 A quick survey of pre-Buddhsit literature shows that the Sanskrit form
 <em>
  skandha
 </em>
 appears a few senses.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  log or tree-trunk (RV 1.32.5)
 </li>
 <li>
  shoulders
 </li>
 <li>
  “division” of the teaching (
  <em>
   dharmaskandha
  </em>
  , a particularly Buddhist-sounding term from Chandogya Upaniṣad 2.23.1).
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Thus, like
 <em>
  upādāna
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  khandha
 </em>
 doesn’t have any intrinsic connection with fire. The primary metaphor is the hand
 <img alt=":vulcan_salute:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="media/Is everything really burning though_ An inquiry into Gombrich_s _Everything is Burning_ the centrali_08.png" title=":vulcan_salute:" width="20"/>
 with fire as a secondary illustration in some contexts.

</p>
<hr/>
<p>
 Overall I find that these terms are not quite as fiery as Gombrich makes out. While his general thesis is both correct and interesting—that fire imagery is used in important ways in Buddhist texts in response to Vedic ideas—the imagery in these terms is only really prominent when brought to the surface through explicit metaphors. Apart from Nibbana—which, to be sure, is a major exception—the basic terms discussed here are not intrinsically connected with fire.
</p>
<p>
 The rest of Gombrich’s chapter is not directly related to my concerns here; it discusses fire in the context of consciousness. It’s good, you should check it out. In fact the whole book is a rewarding and stimulating read.
