 In the Suttas we fairly commonly encounter the term
 <em>
  uddesa
 </em>
 is a specific sense as contrasted with
 <em>
  vibhaṅga
 </em>
 . The former is said to be “in brief”, the latter “in detail”. Usually
 <em>
  uddesa
 </em>
 is translated as “summary, synopsis”. And no doubt, it is something like that.
</p>
<p>
 However, another very common sense of
 <em>
  uddesa
 </em>
 is “recitation”. It seems to me that these two meaning are more closely connected than is apparent if we translate using terms like “summary”.
</p>
<p>
 In fact, from the usage, it seems that
 <em>
  uddesa
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  vibhaṅga
 </em>
 correspond to a very common structure of Buddhist texts. We often find a short, memorable statement,—which may be a verse, a rule, a short Dhamma saying, and so on—which was intended to be strictly memorized and recited. It would be accompanied by a longer commentary, analysis, or explanation, which would originally be more flexible, but over time would come to be fixed in the same way. I think that is exactly what
 <em>
  uddesa
 </em>
 means, and why it is paired with
 <em>
  vibhaṅga
 </em>
 . The
 <em>
  uddesa
 </em>
 is a short passage which is intended to be memorized literally and recited.
</p>
<p>
 Consider the Bhaddekaratta Suttas. (MN 131, MN 132, MN 133, MN 134) they all contain the same
 <em>
  uddesa
 </em>
 , given originally by the Buddha, and specifically said to be something that one should memorize, and the
 <em>
  vibhaṅgas
 </em>
 which vary, and may be taught by others apart from the Buddha.
</p>
<p>
 I think this is a critical feature of the early Buddhist oral texts, and we should make it clear in translation by specifying “passage for recitation” or something similar.
