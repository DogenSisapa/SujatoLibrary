 I have revised this little note in 2023, so the comments may reflect an earlier version.
</p>
<p>
 In MN 40, we have a description of a bad mendicant. Their bad qualities and behavior are said to be like a deadly dagger that they keep stashed away inside their outer robe (
 <em>
  saṇghāti
 </em>
 ). The translation by Ven Bodhi doesn’t convey the point of the simile, though it was caught by the earlier translations by Horner and Chalmers.
</p>
<p>
 The description of the weapon is unique and difficult. With word-by-word rendering
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   matajaṃ nāma āvudhajātaṃ ubhatodhāraṃ pītanisitaṃ
  </em>
  <br/>
  mataja-named—kind of weapon—double-edged—(yellow)-whetted
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The commentary gives a long explanation for
 <em>
  mataja
 </em>
 , which literally means “deadborn”. First you mix up iron filings with meat, then feed it to a heron. When the heron has had enough it dies or is killed, and the iron filings are recovered from its belly. Skilled metalworkers forge a weapon from them. Perhaps the digestive fluids were felt to chemically harden the metal?
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Dhārā
 </em>
 here means
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/define/dh%C4%81r%C4%81">
  edge
 </a>
 , in a sense apparently unattested elsewhere in the EBTs. (But see Brahmali’s comment below.)
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Nisita
 </em>
 means “sharpened” or “whetted”.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Pīta
 </em>
 is problematic. It means either “having drunk” or “yellow”, neither of which makes obvious sense. The commentary takes it in the former sense, saying that the blade has been whetted on a stone soaked in water. This sense has been accepted by previous translators.
</p>
<p>
 However, the Sanskrit dictionaries give another sense of
 <em>
  pīta
 </em>
 : orpiment or “yellow arsenic”.

   Orpiment is a deep-colored, orange-yellow arsenic sulfide mineral with formula As2S3. It is found in volcanic fumaroles, low-temperature hydrothermal veins, and hot springs and may be formed through sublimation.
 Orpiment takes its name from the Latin auripigmentum (aurum, "gold" + pigmentum, "pigment"), due to its deep-yellow color. Orpiment once was widely used in artworks, medicine, and other applications. Because of its toxicity and instability, its usage has declined.
 The Latin auripigmentu...

 This was widely used in metallurgy, especially for hardening bronzes for weaponry. This was

  invented in Iran in the 4th millenium BCE, from where it spread to India

 . The garlic-smelling fumes of toxic arsenic were so characteristic of sword-smithies that they are, so it seems, the cause of the Greek god Hephaestus’ lameness. Alone of all the gods, he suffered a physical defect, which was probably inferred from the common sight of metalworkers suffering lameness through muscle atrophy due to long-term exposure to arsenic and lead.
</p>
<p>
 Whether this sense is meant is uncertain. But there is another nuance to this. Arthaśāstra 2.14.48 describes how metals may be rubbed with yellow arsenic (here =
 <em>
  haritāla
 </em>
 ) to disguise them. The abrasive yellow qualities of orpiment were used for polishing mirrors. And apparently this was exploited as a trick by merchants to pass off inferior metals.
</p>
<p>
 This fits the context well, as the idea is of a weapon that is disguised by a “yellow” gloss, like a bad monk wrapped in their “yellow” robes.
</p>
<p>
 This brings us back to
 <em>
  nisita
 </em>
 . As well as “whetted”, the Sanskrit dictionaries give
 <em>
  niśita
 </em>
 in the sense of “strengthened, prepared” and even “iron, steel”. These meanings probably overlap, used for a hardened and whetted blade. But it also has the sense of “excited, eager”, which by good luck we can capture with “keen”.
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps we could translate the phrase as:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   matajaṃ nāma āvudhajātaṃ ubhatodhāraṃ pītanisitaṃ
  </em>
  <br/>
  the kind of weapon called ‘deadborn’—double-edged, whetted with yellow arsenic
