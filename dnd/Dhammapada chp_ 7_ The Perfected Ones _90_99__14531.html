<p>
 At journey’s end, rid of sorrow;
 <br/>
 freed in every way,
 <br/>
 all ties given up,
 <br/>
 no fever is found in them.
</p>
<p>
 The mindful apply themselves;
 <br/>
 they delight in no abode.
 <br/>
 Like a swan from the marsh that’s gone,
 <br/>
 they leave home after home behind.
</p>
<p>
 They who have nothing stored up,
 <br/>
 who have understood their food,
 <br/>
 whose domain is the liberation
 <br/>
 of the signless and the empty:
 <br/>
 their path is hard to trace,
 <br/>
 like that of birds in the sky.
</p>
<p>
 One whose defilements have ended;
 <br/>
 who’s not attached to food;
 <br/>
 whose domain is the liberation
 <br/>
 of the signless and the empty:
 <br/>
 their track is hard to trace,
 <br/>
 like that of birds in the sky.
</p>
<p>
 One whose faculties have become serene,
 <br/>
 like horses tamed by a charioteer,
 <br/>
 who has abandoned conceit and defilements:
 <br/>
 such a one is envied even by the gods.
</p>
<p>
 Untroubled just like the earth;
 <br/>
 true to their vows, steady as a boundary pillar;
 <br/>
 like a lake cleansed of mud,
 <br/>
 the poised do not transmigrate.
</p>
<p>
 Their mind is peaceful;
 <br/>
 peaceful are their speech and deeds.
 <br/>
 A poised one is at peace,
 <br/>
 rightly freed through enlightenment.
</p>
<p>
 A faithless person, a house-breaker,
 <br/>
 who fails to appreciate what has been done,
 <br/>
 purged of hope, they’ve wasted their chance:
 <br/>
 that is indeed the supreme person!
</p>
<p>
 Whether in village or wilderness,
 <br/>
 in a valley or the uplands,
 <br/>
 wherever the perfected ones live
 <br/>
 is a delightful place.
</p>
<p>
 Delightful are the wildernesses
 <br/>
 where no people delight.
 <br/>
 Those free of greed will delight there,
 <br/>
 not those who seek sensual pleasures.
