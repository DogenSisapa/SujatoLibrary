  <h1>A small problem with SN 1.2</h1>
  <p><em>2025-02-17T08:08:05.910Z</em></p>
  <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/a-small-problem-with-sn-1-2/38211">https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/a-small-problem-with-sn-1-2/38211</a></p>
  <p>
 There seems to be a textual corruption in SN 1.2. Only the first two lines of the “verse” are metrical, and it seems as if the remainder, while treated as verse in the MS edition, should be prose. But the flow of the prose is not entirely clear either. The line “Due to the cessation and stilling of feelings” seems awkward and does not have a parallel (?) Perhaps it is extraneous or garbled?
</p>
<p>
 Now, there are two Chinese parallels, and I’m wondering if

 can help me out here. I think that in the SA 1268 parallel, it seems like it is translating the first two lines of verse? And the other parallel seems less clear?
</p>
<p>
 I’m wondering if it’s best to change the HTML so that it would be something like:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  “But how is it that you understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion for sentient beings?”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Because I have ended relish for rebirth,
  <br/>
  and finished with perception and consciousness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the cessation and stilling of feelings, that, good sir, is how I understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion for sentient beings.”
