<p>
 Regard one who sees your faults
 <br/>
 as a guide to a hidden treasure.
 <br/>
 Stay close to one so wise and astute
 <br/>
 who corrects you when you need it.
</p>
<p>
 If you stay close to one such as this,
 <br/>
 things get better, not worse.
 <br/>
 One who would advise and instruct,
 <br/>
 shielding you from what is bad,
 <br/>
 is beloved by the good,
 <br/>
 but disliked by the bad.
</p>
<p>
 Don’t stay around bad friends,
 <br/>
 nor with the worst of men.
 <br/>
 Associate with spiritual friends,
 <br/>
 and with the best of men.
</p>
<p>
 Through joy in the teaching you sleep at ease,
 <br/>
 with clear and confident heart.
 <br/>
 An astute person always delights in the teaching
 <br/>
 proclaimed by the noble one.
</p>
<p>
 While irrigators guide water,
 <br/>
 fletchers straighten arrows,
 <br/>
 and carpenters carve timber—
 <br/>
 the astute tame themselves.
</p>
<p>
 As the wind cannot stir
 <br/>
 a solid mass of rock,
 <br/>
 so too praise and blame
 <br/>
 do not affect the wise.
</p>
<p>
 Like a deep lake,
 <br/>
 clear and unclouded,
 <br/>
 so clear are the astute
 <br/>
 when they hear the teachings.
</p>
<p>
 Good people give up everything,
 <br/>
 they speak not of the things they desire.
 <br/>
 Though touched by sadness or happiness,
 <br/>
 the astute appear neither depressed nor elated.
</p>
<p>
 Never wish for success by unjust means,
 <br/>
 not for your own sake or that of another,
 <br/>
 nor wishing for children or wealth or nation;
 <br/>
 rather, one should be virtuous, wise, and just.
</p>
<p>
 Few are those among humans
 <br/>
 who cross to the far shore.
 <br/>
 The rest just run around
 <br/>
 on the near shore.
</p>
<p>
 When the teaching is well explained,
 <br/>
 those who practice accordingly
 <br/>
 are the ones who will cross over
 <br/>
 Death’s domain so hard to pass.
</p>
<p>
 Rid of dark qualities,
 <br/>
 an astute person should develop the bright.
 <br/>
 Leaving home behind
 <br/>
 for the seclusion so hard to enjoy,
 <br/>
 find delight there,
 <br/>
 having left behind sensual pleasures.
</p>
<p>
 With no possessions, an astute person
 <br/>
 would cleanse themselves of mental corruptions.
 <br/>
 Those whose minds are rightly developed
 <br/>
 in the awakening factors;
 <br/>
 who, letting go of attachments,
 <br/>
 delight in not grasping:
 <br/>
 with defilements ended, brilliant,
 <br/>
 they in this world are quenched.
