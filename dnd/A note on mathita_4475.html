  <h1>A note on mathita</h1>

 In MN 72 we find the rather obscure term
 <em>
  mathita
 </em>
 . Ven Bodhi, followed by Ven Thanissaro, has “excogitations”, which, apart from being obscure, has the wrong sense:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  To consider or think (something) out carefully and thoroughly.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Horner has “supposing”, apparently taking it as a straight synonym for
 <em>
  maññati
 </em>
 , with which it occurs in parallel. The dictionaries
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/define/mathita">
  are not hugely helpful
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 But at Thag 14.2 we have:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Yathāpi bhaddo ājañño,
  </em>
  <br/>
  Just as a fine thoroughbred,
  <br/>
  <em>
   dhure yutto dhurassaho;
  </em>
  <br/>
  Yoked to a carriage, endures the load,
  <br/>
  <em>
   Mathito atibhārena,
  </em>
  <br/>
  Oppressed by the heavy burden,
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here it clearly means “oppressed, weighed down”, and the same sense probably applies at Thag 1.102, too.
</p>
<p>
 So in a psychological sense it would be “burdens, anxieties, worries”. The passage would then read:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Tasmā tathāgato sabbamaññitānaṃ sabbamathitānaṃ sabbaahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayānaṃ khayā virāgā nirodhā cāgā paṭinissaggā anupādā vimuttoti vadāmi
  </em>
  <br/>
  That’s why the Realized One is freed with the ending, fading away, cessation, giving up, and letting go of all conceivings, all worries, and all ego, possessiveness, or tendency to conceit, I say.
