<p>
 The mind, it quivers and shakes,
 <br/>
 hard to guard, hard to curb.
 <br/>
 The discerning straighten it out,
 <br/>
 like a fletcher straightens an arrow.
</p>
<p>
 Like a fish pulled from the sea
 <br/>
 and cast up on the shore,
 <br/>
 this mind thrashes about,
 <br/>
 trying to throw off Māra’s sway.
</p>
<p>
 Hard to hold back, flighty,
 <br/>
 alighting where it will;
 <br/>
 it’s good to tame the mind—
 <br/>
 a tamed mind leads to bliss.
</p>
<p>
 So very hard to see, so subtle,
 <br/>
 alighting where it will;
 <br/>
 the discerning protect the mind,
 <br/>
 a guarded mind leads to bliss.
</p>
<p>
 The mind travels far, wandering alone;
 <br/>
 incorporeal, it hides in a cave.
 <br/>
 Those who will restrain the mind
 <br/>
 are freed from Māra’s bonds.
</p>
<p>
 Those of unsteady mind,
 <br/>
 who don’t understand the true teaching,
 <br/>
 and whose confidence wavers,
 <br/>
 do not perfect their wisdom.
</p>
<p>
 One whose mind is uncorrupted,
 <br/>
 whose heart is undamaged,
 <br/>
 who’s given up right and wrong—
 <br/>
 alert, has nothing to fear.
</p>
<p>
 Knowing this body breaks like a pot,
 <br/>
 fortifying the mind like a citadel,
 <br/>
 attack Māra with the sword of wisdom;
 <br/>
 guard your conquest, and never settle.
</p>
<p>
 All too soon this body
 <br/>
 will lie down upon the earth,
 <br/>
 bereft of consciousness,
 <br/>
 tossed aside like a useless old log.
</p>
<p>
 Whatever a hater might do to the hated,
 <br/>
 or an enemy to their foe,
 <br/>
 a wrongly directed mind
 <br/>
 would do much worse than that to them.
</p>
<p>
 Not even a mother or father,
 <br/>
 or other relative would do so much;
 <br/>
 a rightly directed mind
 <br/>
 would do better than that to them.
</p>
