 Pali has a rich vocabulary of words for speaking and the voice. Many of these are used so commonly that they can only be read in a generic sense. However,
 <em>
  ghosa
 </em>
 , while usually simply translated as “voice” or “speech”, is quite rare, and used in a limited set of contexts. I will collect the characteristic phrases here.

<blockquote>
 <ul>
  <li>
   MN 43, on the causes of right view:
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 <li>
  <em>
   parato ca ghoso, yoniso ca manasikāro
  </em>
 </li>
 <li>
  the
  <em>
   ghosa
  </em>
  of another and rational focus
 </li>
 <li>
  MN 84, on the sectarian claims of the brahmins:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <em>
     Ghosoyeva kho eso, mahārāja, lokasmiṃ
    </em>
   </li>
   <li>
    Great king, that’s only a
    <em>
     ghosa
    </em>
    in the world
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  SN 8.6, on Sāriputta’s teaching voice:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <em>
     Sāḷikāyiva nigghoso
    </em>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  His
  <em>
   nigghosa
  </em>
  , like a myna bird,
 </li>
 <li>
  AN 3.80, on the Buddha’s manifesting of sound across the universe:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <em>
     Yadā te sattā taṃ ālokaṃ sañjāneyyuṃ, atha tathāgato ghosaṃ kareyya saddamanussāveyya
    </em>
   </li>
   <li>
    When sentient beings saw the light, the Realized One would project his
    <em>
     ghosa
    </em>
    so that they’d hear the sound.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  AN 4.65:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <em>
     Rūpappamāṇo rūpappasanno, ghosappamāṇo ghosappasanno, lūkhappamāṇo lūkhappasanno, dhammappamāṇo dhammappasanno
    </em>
   </li>
   <li>
    There are those whose estimation of and confidence in others is based on appearance, on
    <em>
     ghosa
    </em>
    , on mortification, and on principle.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  Thag 19.1:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <em>
     Mahindaghosatthanitābhigajjino
    </em>
   </li>
   <li>
    Greeting the thunder, Mahinda’s
    <em>
     ghosa
    </em>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 That’s not all the occurrences in the suttas, but it’s most of them. It seems the use of
 <em>
  ghosa
 </em>
 is typically rather more potent than ordinary speech. It’s used in contexts that emphasize the persuasive quality of a voice, or its far-reaching power. While we might not be able to capture this exactly in English, perhaps “call” would be a step in the right direction. In MN 84 the sense comes close to “propaganda”.
