 Venerable Analayo asked me if I’d post this here. It’s his review of Ichimura’s translation of the Dīrgha-āgama from the Chinese, published by Numata.

 The Numata series is an ambitious project to translate the entire Chinese canon into English. Analayo himself, together with Rod Bucknell and others, have translated the Madhyama-āgama as part of the same series.

 The Dīrgha-āgama was the first full translation of a Chinese Āgama into English, and hopes were high that it would signal a new stage in understanding of these important texts. Unfortunately, the translation was of disappointing quality, and in this review Analayo shows exactly why that is so.

<p>
 For 2,500 years we Buddhists have been caring for and looking after our texts. This includes translations, which are believed to be the “words of the Buddha” in the same sense as the original. It is a sacred duty and a grave responsibility. Without a clear and informed perspective on when and why translations can go right or wrong, we cannot ensure the continued viability of the Dhamma.
