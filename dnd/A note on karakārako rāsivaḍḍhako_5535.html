 In DN 2, in the passage on the second fruit of the ascetic life, the Buddha is indicating some of the simple fruits of the spiritual life to King Ajātasattu. A person is described as a working man of some substance, in contrast with the servant of the previous passage. A couple of the terms in the description are rare, and have been rather imperfectly translated hitherto.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   idha te assa puriso kassako gahapatiko karakārako rāsivaḍḍhako
  </em>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Ven Bodhi has:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  a farmer, a householder, who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Which seems to follow the paraphrase of Rhys Davids:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  a free man who cultivates his land, a householder, who pays taxes and thus increases the king’s wealth
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Thanissaro follows suit:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Only Walshe differs:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  a farmer, a householder, in your service, the steward of an estate
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The rendering only partly follows the commentary:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Balisaṅkhātaṃ karaṃ karotīti karakārako. Dhaññarāsiṃ dhanarāsiñca vaḍḍhetīti rāsivaḍḍhako.
  </em>
  <br/>
  A “hard worker” is one who does the duty reckoned as taxes (too literal, it just means one who pays their taxes.) A “heap-increaser” is someone who increases the heap of grain and the heap of wealth.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 There’s nothing that specifies that the wealth that is increased is that of the king.
</p>
<p>
 But to return to the suttas, the term
 <em>
  karakāraka
 </em>
 , perhaps surprisingly, only occurs in one other context. This is in MN 57, in reference to the naked dog-duty ascetic, who is said to be someone who “does a hard thing” or “performs a difficult duty”,
 <em>
  dukkarakārako
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 So there is nothing in the word itself that suggests it means “tax-payer”. Rather, it just means a “hard worker”, someone who does their job.
</p>
<p>
 Then, given that even the commentary does not associate
 <em>
  rāsivaḍḍhaka
 </em>
 with paying taxes, it seems simpler to just take it to mean that they are an “investor”, someone who prudently saves and builds up their property, rather than squandering it.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   idha te assa puriso kassako gahapatiko karakārako rāsivaḍḍhako
  </em>
  <br/>
  Suppose there was a person of yours who was a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It’s only a minor difference, but I found it an interesting one, because it suggests a different strategy in dealing with Ajātasattu. If we take the terms as referring to taxation, then the Buddha is appealing to Ajātasattu’s self-interest. But if it is simply a good citizen and responsible worker, he is expecting Ajātasattu to respond on an ethical level. Such nuances shed a new light on one of the most fascinating characters in Buddhist history.
