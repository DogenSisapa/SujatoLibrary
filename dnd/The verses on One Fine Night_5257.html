  <p>
 One of the most powerful and popular sets of verses on practice are those taught in a series of texts on One Fine Night (MN 131. MN 132, MN 133, MN 134 and their various parallels). As usual, while the overall sense of the verses is clear, there are a number of textual problems when you get down to details.
</p>
<p>
 Now, normally this is where I point out the problems, show what previous translators have done, and explain if I have taken a different tack. But how about we do something different?
</p>
<p>
 Here’s the verses. Compare it to previous translations (unfortunately, Ven Bodhi’s version is locked under copyright), then tell me, why have I done it this way? And is there anything I could do better?
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Atītaṃ nānvāgameyya,
  </em>
  <br/>
  Don’t run back to the past,
  <br/>
  <em>
   nappaṭikaṅkhe anāgataṃ;
  </em>
  <br/>
  don’t hope for the future.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Yadatītaṃ pahīnaṃ taṃ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  What’s past is left behind;
  <br/>
  <em>
   appattañca anāgataṃ.
  </em>
  <br/>
  the future’s not arrived;
  <br/>
  <em>
   Paccuppannañca yo dhammaṃ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  and phenomena in the present
  <br/>
  <em>
   Tattha tattha vipassati;
  </em>
  <br/>
  are clearly seen in every case.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Asaṃhīraṃ asaṃkuppaṃ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  Knowing this, foster it—
  <br/>
  <em>
   Taṃ vidvā manubrūhaye.
  </em>
  <br/>
  immovable, unshakable.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Ajjeva kiccamātappaṃ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  Today’s the day to do the work—
  <br/>
  <em>
   ko jaññā maraṇaṃ suve;
  </em>
  <br/>
  who knows, tomorrow may bring death!
  <br/>
  <em>
   Na hi no saṅgaraṃ tena,
  </em>
  <br/>
  For there is no bargain to be struck
  <br/>
  <em>
   mahāsenena maccunā.
  </em>
  <br/>
  with Death and his mighty hordes.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Evaṃvihāriṃ ātāpiṃ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  The peaceful sage explained it’s those
  <br/>
  <em>
   ahorattamatanditaṃ;
  </em>
  <br/>
  who keenly meditate like this,
  <br/>
  <em>
   Taṃ ve bhaddekarattoti,
  </em>
  <br/>
  not slacking off by night or day,
  <br/>
  <em>
   santo ācikkhate muni.
  </em>
  <br/>
  who truly have that one fine night.
