 There is a moment of purity in any creative’s process. The page is blank. The canvas is clean. The air is silent. There is an openness, an emptiness that cries out to be filled. Something inside the creative’s mind is pushing, some craving, some desire. To say something, paint something, sing something. They start, fumbling, awkward.
</p>
<p>
 It’s bad, they know it is. It’s bad because they’d feel ashamed to show their friends, or because it’s not what they are supposed to do. But really, it’s bad because it destroys the emptiness. If any creative work is to be worthwhile, it must at least be better than the emptiness it ruins.
</p>
<p>
 They wipe it out, try again. Wander around, get a coffee, waste time. Maybe they’ll get writer’s block. Maybe they make something mediocre. They know they can do better. So they wipe it out again.
</p>
<p>
 They go deeper, until they access something that they’ve never seen before. Something new comes up, a spark, a phrase, color, a set of tones. When that is expressed, when it exists out there in the world, it has a presence of its own. It is a struggle, but it’s worth it. It is through the process that we become more fully human.
</p>
<p>
 Every student knows this struggle. Or up till now they did. Now they can just put a prompt into ChaptGPT, get the output, and paste in as an essay. Maybe do a bit of editing and tidying up, maybe not. AI bilge is filling students essays, academic papers, media, social media. Per an article in ArsTechnica, “

 They say AI will unleash an age of creativity and discovery. I doubt it: what kind of person are we creating who has never had a moment of true creativity or struggled to find an idea? It’s impossible to overstate the importance of this. AI doesn’t give, it takes. It takes the creative and intelligent output of humans, mashes it up, and spits it out. Those who advocate it feel a sense of entitlement to the work of others, to appropriating literally all of human culture and making it into something they can sell.
</p>
<p>
 It even threatens to destroy itself via “model collapse”: as AI models consume their own output, they become like inbreds, their output growing increasingly grotesque and distorted in a

 It’s been a while since I was in school, so I’ve taken to asking students about it. So far, not a single one says it’s actually useful. Maybe the future is okay after all.

 AI systematically undermines human consciousness, because that is its purpose. It is a product of faith in machines, built by people who have lost faith in humanity.
 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">
  New Yorker quotes Sam Altman
 </a>
 reflecting on the near future of humanity that he is creating:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  “There’s absolutely no reason to believe that in about thirteen years we won’t have hardware capable of replicating my brain. Yes, certain things still feel particularly human—creativity, flashes of inspiration from nowhere, the ability to feel happy and sad at the same time—but computers will have their own desires and goal systems. When I realized that intelligence can be simulated, I let the idea of our uniqueness go, and it wasn’t as traumatic as I thought.” He stared off. “There are certain advantages to being a machine. We humans are limited by our input-output rate—we learn only two bits a second, so a ton is lost. To a machine, we must seem like slowed-down whale songs.”
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Altman calls himself “team human”, which is one of those tech phrases that become weirder the more you think about, as it implies there’s a “team inhuman”. Also notice how Altman, in this quote from 2016, casually says the very specific “thirteen years” as if there’s some scientific or evidential basis for making these kinds of claims. Now we’re in 2024, so we’ve got five years left!

 AI “safety” is created by the labor of thousands of workers, mostly in Africa, who are paid a pittance to stare at screens all day and filter out the

 We are told of the breakthroughs and new insights that AI will offer. As my valued respondents have reminded me, we have seen a genuine advance in the use of AI to
 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphafold-ai-protein-structure-folding-prediction">
  decode protein structures with AlphaFold
 </a>
 . And there are many other processes that use this technology every day, most of which we are not aware of.
</p>
<p>
 The technology itself has advantages and disadvantages, and if these were the only, or the main, uses, then I wouldn’t be writing these “diatribes”. I’m writing them to raise awareness of the costs, so that we stop being complacent about letting this technology invade every sphere of our life. And so that we take back the reins, and ensure that future development is guided by strong and responsible legislation in the public interest.
</p>
<p>
 With due acknowledgements to the roles that AI can have in tasks like predicting protein structures, it remains the case that virtually every significant scientific and technological achievement has been made by the human mind. If we want genuine scientific advances, the answer is not to give blind faith to a technology. It is to nurture humans. Stop creating economic structures that end up with young people wanting to be an influencer or a billionaire. Improve STEM education, ensuring that scientists also get a well-rounded education in the humanities. Pay teachers. Feed children. Give decent budgets to scientists, with plenty of down time for relaxation.
</p>
<p>
 Insights arise from the human mind when it is confronted with emptiness and listens to the upwelling of what might fill it. Our machines are great, better than they have ever been. Our minds could do with some love.
