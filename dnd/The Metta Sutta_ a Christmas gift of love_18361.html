 Today I translated the Metta Sutta, and I made a recording to go along with it. May it bring happiness to you and your loved ones. May there be peace on earth and goodwill for all beings.

 <h2>
  The Discourse on Love
 </h2>
 <p>
  This is what should be done by those who are skilled in goodness,
  <br/>
  and who know the place of peace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let them be able and upright, very upright,
  <br/>
  easy to speak to, gentle and humble;
  <br/>
  content and unburdensome,
  <br/>
  unbusied, living lightly,
  <br/>
  alert, with senses calmed,
  <br/>
  courteous, not fawning on families.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let them not do the slightest thing
  <br/>
  that others might blame with reason.
 </p>
 <p>
  May they be happy and safe!
  <br/>
  May all beings be happy!
 </p>
 <p>
  Whatever living creatures there are
  <br/>
  with not a one left outâ€”
  <br/>
  frail or firm, long or large,
  <br/>
  medium, small, tiny or round,
  <br/>
  visible or invisible,
  <br/>
  living far or near,
  <br/>
  those born or to be born:
  <br/>
  May all beings be happy!
 </p>
 <p>
  Let none turn from one another,
  <br/>
  nor look down on anyone anywhere.
  <br/>
  Though provoked or aggrieved,
  <br/>
  let them not wish pain on each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even as a mother would protect with her life
  <br/>
  her child, her only child,
  <br/>
  so too for all creatures
  <br/>
  unfold a boundless heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  With love for the whole world,
  <br/>
  unfold a boundless heart.
  <br/>
  Above, below, all round,
  <br/>
  unconstricted, without enemy or foe.
 </p>
 <p>
  When standing, walking, sitting,
  <br/>
  or lying down while still wakeful,
  <br/>
  keep this ever in mind,
  <br/>
  for this, they say, is a holy abiding in this life.
 </p>
 <p>
  (Avoiding harmful views,
  <br/>
  virtuous, accomplished in insight,
  <br/>
  with sensual desire dispelled,
  <br/>
  they never come back to a womb again.)
 </p>
