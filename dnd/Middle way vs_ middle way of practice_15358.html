 While it is well known that the Buddha called his path the “middle way” in his first sermon, it is somewhat less well known that a similar phrase is used to describe the philosophical dimensions of the teaching. In fact the phrase
 <em>
  majjhena desanā
 </em>
 “teaching by the middle” occurs three times as often as the more familiar “middle way of practice”, which perhaps surprisingly only occurs five times in the suttas.

 Translating
 <em>
  majjhena desanā
 </em>
 is a little hard, because “teaching by the middle” is too literal and abrupt, while “teaching by the middle way”, which I have adopted, risks confusion with the practice. I’ve chosen to solve this by adding “of practice” where needed.

<ul>
 <li>
  <em>
   majjhimā paṭipadā
  </em>
  : the middle way of practice
 </li>
 <li>
  <em>
   majjhena desanā
  </em>
  : teaching by the middle way
