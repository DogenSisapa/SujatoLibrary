 Among the 32 marks of the great man, we find
 <em>
  brahmujugatta
 </em>
 , usually translated as “his body is as straight as that of Brahmā".
</p>
<p>
 However it seems that here we have an adjective from √brah + ma, equivalent to the Sanskrit
 <a href="https://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=b%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%83h&amp;iencoding=iast&amp;lang=sans">
  <em>
   bṛṃh
  </em>
 </a>
 , having the sense “grown, extended” or in this case, “tall”. Thus we should translate, “his body is tall and straight” or something similar.
</p>
<p>
 The commentary consistently glosses this phrase with:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Brahmujugattoti brahmā viya ujugatto, ujumeva uggatadīghasarīro
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Brahmujugatta
  </em>
  means as straight as Brahmā, his body is quite straight and grown long.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Thus it admits of both explanations.
</p>
<p>
 This sense of
 <em>
  brahma
 </em>
 is not found in Cone’s DoP, which treats this phrase under the normal
 <em>
  brahma
 </em>
 . I noticed it due to the
 <em>
  Digital Pāli Dictionary
 </em>
 , an excellent resource which, as here, sometimes contains senses missed in other dictionaries.
