 Abstract
</h6>
<p>
 Devadatta is de­picted as the ar­che­typal vil­lain in all Buddhist tra­di­tions. Reginald Ray has ar­gued for a rad­i­cal re­assess­ment of Devadatta as a for­est saint who was un­fairly ma­ligned in later monas­tic Buddhism. His work has been in­flu­en­tial, but it re­lies on omis­sions and mis­taken read­ings of the sources. Ray’s claim that ‘there is no over­lap be­tween the Mahāsaṅghika treat­ment [of Devadatta] and that of the five [Sthavira] schools’ is un­true. On the con­trary, the man­ner in which Devadatta is de­picted in the Mahāsaṅghika is broadly sim­i­lar to the Sthavira ac­counts. Such dif­fer­ences as do ex­ist are lit­er­ary rather than doc­tri­nal. The sto­ries of Devadatta’s de­prav­ity be­came in­creas­ingly lurid in later Buddhism, but this is a nor­mal fea­ture of the mythol­o­giz­ing process, and has noth­ing to do with any an­tag­o­nism against for­est as­cetics. In any case, the early sources are unan­i­mous in con­demn­ing Devadatta as the in­sti­ga­tor of the first schism in the Buddhist com­mu­nity.
</p>
<h3>
 Introduction
</h3>
<p>
 In 1994 Reginald Ray pub­lished Buddhist Saints in India, a lengthy book on the ‘for­est saint’ of Buddhist lit­er­a­ture. It told of how the wild, un­pre­dictable sage of the for­est was the orig­i­nal Buddhist ideal of saint­hood, or ara­hantship, but was sup­planted by the se­date, rule-bound monas­tics of later years. This ro­man­tic tale was sup­ported by an ex­ten­sive frame­work of schol­ar­ship.
</p>
<p>
 There is some­thing to this idea, and Ray was right to em­pha­size the im­por­tance of the for­est sage. The ten­sion be­tween the life of med­i­ta­tive seclu­sion in the for­est and set­tled monas­ti­cism in the city is still felt in Buddhist cul­tures to­day, and Ray does much to bring the some­times ob­scure for­est life back into fo­cus.
</p>
<p>
 Nevertheless, Ray fell into the all-too-common trap of over-dramatizing his the­sis. It wasn’t enough to sim­ply high­light the role of the for­est sages; he had to re­con­struct Buddhist his­tory as a vast move­ment ded­i­cated to sup­press­ing these icon­o­clas­tic, charis­matic he­roes. Given the anti-establishment roots of Western Buddhism, such rad­i­cal no­tions will al­ways find ea­ger ears, de­spite his flawed han­dling of his­tory.
</p>
<p>
 These flaws are nowhere more ap­par­ent than in his as­ton­ish­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of the so-called ‘con­demned saint’, Devadatta. This meme has had a sur­pris­ing tenac­ity. It is re­peated as if it were au­thor­i­ta­tive, and is used as a ba­sis for fur­ther ar­gu­ments on any­thing from veg­e­tar­i­an­ism to the au­then­tic­ity of monas­tic life.

 But it is wrong, and I would like to show why.
</p>
<p>
 Ray’s ar­gu­ment re­lies on two stud­ies, by Mukherjee and Bareau. I do not have ac­cess to these, so my crit­i­cisms are not of them, but rather of the way they have been used by Ray.
</p>
<h3>
 Devadatta wasn’t all bad
</h3>
<p>
 Ray starts by re­count­ing the tra­di­tional ver­sion of Devadatta’s story, say­ing he is de­picted as an ‘in­vet­er­ate evil­doer’. He ar­gues that the tra­di­tions’ bias against Devadatta as an as­cetic for­est saint in­flu­enced them to cre­ate ever more lurid ac­counts of Devadatta’s evil deeds. He goes on to ac­knowl­edge that Devadatta’s po­si­tion as an evil­doer is not en­tirely con­sis­tent, giv­ing a few ex­am­ples where he ap­pears in a more pos­i­tive light.
</p>
<p>
 Ray seems to think that these two per­spec­tives are con­tra­dic­tory. But they are noth­ing of the sort. The story of Devadatta is not that of an ‘in­vet­er­ate evil­doer’, but of a fall from grace: a tal­ented med­i­ta­tor with psy­chic pow­ers, who be­came cor­rupted by jeal­ousy and greed, and com­mit­ted many bad deeds, be­fore fi­nally seek­ing re­demp­tion.
</p>
<p>
 Devadatta’s good qual­i­ties are re­quired by the doc­trine of kamma. Power in this life can only come from good kamma in past lives. The Buddha could not have been threat­ened by a no­body. His ad­ver­sary must have been some­one whose birth was as ex­alted as the Buddha’s, who was tal­ented in the mun­dane achieve­ments of con­cen­tra­tion and psy­chic powers—but not in the stages of Awakening—someone so charis­matic he could sway a pow­er­ful king to his will. In other words, it had to be some­one like Devadatta.
</p>
<p>
 If early ver­sions of Devadatta’s life con­tained no good qual­i­ties, the tra­di­tions would have had to in­vent them. So along­side the in­creas­ingly im­plau­si­ble list of crimes at­trib­uted to Devadatta, we also find im­plau­si­ble strengths. Literally: the Pali com­men­taries say Devadatta had the strength of five ele­phants.

</p>
<p>
 The real doc­tri­nal prob­lem is, why are there not more texts that show how Devadatta be­came so pow­er­ful? This is a se­ri­ous prob­lem for the doc­trine of kamma, given that Devadatta’s mis­deeds are recorded at such length in so many past lives. The prob­lem is ad­dressed at length in the Milindapañha, where King Milinda lists a mul­ti­tude of Devadatta’s for­tu­nate births, and asks Nāgasena how to ex­plain this. Nāgasena says that when Devadatta had been a ruler he had pro­tected the land, built bridges and halls, and had been gen­er­ous to as­cetics and those in need.
 <a href="#tthFtNtAAD" name="tthFrefAAD">

  </sup>
 </a>
 The tra­di­tions were well aware that Devadatta had some good in him.
</p>
<p>
 However, even though most ref­er­ences to a ‘good’ Devadatta are un­prob­lem­atic, in­deed es­sen­tial to the story, one of Ray’s ex­am­ples of the good Devadatta (162
 <a href="#tthFtNtAAE" name="tthFrefAAE">
  <sup>
   4
  </sup>
 </a>
 ) can­not be ex­plained in this way. Ray refers to a pas­sage in the Pali Udāna, which lists Devadatta along­side sev­eral great monks, call­ing them ‘brah­mans’ and, in the verse that fol­lows, claim­ing that they are ara­hants. If Devadatta was an ara­hant it would be im­pos­si­ble for him to com­mit the crimes that are at­trib­uted to him.
</p>
<p>
 Ray’s source is Woodward’s out­dated trans­la­tion, based on the Pali Text Society edi­tion of the Udāna. The  PTS edi­tion is, how­ever, the only mod­ern edi­tion I have found that men­tions Devadatta in this list. The Royal Thai, Sinhala Buddha Jayanthi, and Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana (Burmese) edi­tions all omit Devadatta.
 <a href="#tthFtNtAAF" name="tthFrefAAF">
  <sup>

  </sup>
 </a>
 Curiously, the  PTS edi­tion does not even men­tion any vari­ant read­ings. Obviously this is a mis­take. More re­cent trans­la­tions by Ireland

 <a href="#tthFtNtAAH" name="tthFrefAAH">
  <sup>

  </sup>
 </a>
 note this, and omit the ref­er­ence to Devadatta.
</p>
<p>
 This is typ­i­cal of Ray’s sloppy use of pri­mary texts. He seems to have not read the texts he refers to, and his third-hand de­scrip­tions of­ten bear lit­tle re­sem­blance to what they ac­tu­ally say. For ex­am­ple, he claims, rather por­ten­tously, that in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Devadatta ‘re­veals him­self as one who has the right view and can preach the cor­rect doc­trine’. Ray gives no ref­er­ence for this star­tling rev­e­la­tion; and in fact no such text ex­ists. Devadatta does not even speak in the Aṅguttara Nikāya.
 <a href="#tthFtNtAAI" name="tthFrefAAI">

  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Even when Ray gets the text right, he mis­rep­re­sents the mean­ing. He says that Sāriputta praised Devadatta’s saint­li­ness, a praise that is con­firmed by the Buddha him­self. What he omits is the con­text.
 <a href="#tthFtNtAAJ" name="tthFrefAAJ">
  <sup>

  </sup>
 </a>
 When Devadatta’s be­hav­ior got out of con­trol, the Buddha asked Sāriputta to in­form the lay folk what was go­ing on.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABA" name="tthFrefABA">
  <sup>
   10
  </sup>
 </a>
 Sāriputta says that he had for­merly praised Devadatta for his great abil­i­ties; the Buddha said that that was true then, and it is true now that Devadatta has changed. This is typ­i­cal of the way Ray picks and chooses from his sources, in the process twist­ing their mean­ing so they be­come un­rec­og­niz­able.
</p>
<p>
 Ray fur­ther ar­gues (163) that Devadatta ap­pears with the char­ac­ter­is­tics of a saint ‘even when the texts are openly hos­tile to him. For ex­am­ple, he is de­picted as one who med­i­tates in soli­tude.’ But the pas­sage he refers to does not de­pict Devadatta as med­i­tat­ing in soli­tude, al­though some trans­la­tions might be taken to im­ply so.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABB" name="tthFrefABB">

 </a>
 The rel­e­vant term
 <i>
  ra­hogatassa paṭisal­lī­nassa
 </i>
 sim­ply means ‘in pri­vate, alone’, and has noth­ing to do with be­ing on a se­cluded med­i­ta­tion re­treat. Under this stan­dard, any­one who spends time think­ing alone in their bed­room would qual­ify as a ‘for­est saint’!
</p>
<p>
 In the same para­graph, Ray says that ‘Devadatta is also a re­al­ized mas­ter and, through his awak­en­ing, is in pos­ses­sion of mag­i­cal power.’ This di­rectly con­tra­dicts the Pali text, which says that Devadatta at­tained the ‘un­en­light­ened person’s psy­chic pow­ers’.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABC" name="tthFrefABC">
  <sup>
   12
  </sup>
 </a>
 Ray mis­un­der­stands the el­e­men­tary Buddhist doc­trine that psy­chic abil­i­ties are not con­nected with Awakening. This is a ba­sic moral of the Devadatta story as un­der­stood by any Buddhist med­i­ta­tor: don’t be sat­is­fied with cheap tricks like psy­chic pow­ers and stop ‘half-way’ like Devadatta!
</p>
<p>
 Ray sums up the open­ing sec­tion of his es­say by say­ing that: ‘This raises the ques­tion of why Devadatta is on the one hand vil­i­fied as the very em­bod­i­ment of evil and on the other de­picted as a re­al­ized saint.’ (163) As I have just shown, this ques­tion is mis­placed. The bulk of these texts of­fer a co­her­ent ac­count of a spir­i­tual fall from grace. There is only one pas­sage cited by Ray where this ex­pla­na­tion doesn’t ap­ply, and in that case Ray re­lies on a faulty text.
</p>
<h3>
 The six Vinayas
</h3>
<p>
 The next sev­eral pages of Ray’s book are de­voted to sum­ma­riz­ing the analy­sis of Devadatta’s story as pre­sented by Mukherjee and Bareau. Most of this is a dis­cus­sion of Devadatta’s leg­end as passed down in the five Vinayas of the Sthavira group of schools. Essentially he shows that the texts of the five Sthavira schools are pretty sim­i­lar, con­sist­ing of fif­teen ba­sic episodes with a few vari­a­tions in struc­ture and de­tail. This is un­prob­lem­atic, but also not par­tic­u­larly ger­mane to his the­sis, so I will pass over it.
</p>
<p>
 Ray then con­trasts the treat­ment of Devadatta (169) in the Sthavira Vinayas with that in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya. To ap­pre­ci­ate this part of the ar­gu­ment, a lit­tle back­ground on the Vinaya texts is in or­der.
</p>
<p>
 The early Buddhist texts are broadly di­vided into doc­trine (Suttas) and monas­tic dis­ci­pline (Vinaya). While both these col­lec­tions con­tain early and later ma­te­r­ial, the Vinaya is, on the whole, some­what later than the Suttas. The story of Devadatta is pri­mar­ily the ac­count of the ear­li­est threat of schism to the Buddhist monas­tic com­mu­nity, and is there­fore told at length in the Vinaya (al­though episodes from his life are also found in the Suttas).
</p>
<p>
 We are for­tu­nate to pos­sess com­plete Vinaya canons of six schools.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABD" name="tthFrefABD">
  <sup>
   13
  </sup>
 </a>
 These fall into two groups, based on the first his­tor­i­cal schism of Buddhism.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABE" name="tthFrefABE">
  <sup>
   14
  </sup>
 </a>
 This schism was be­tween the Sthavira and the Mahāsaṅghika.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABF" name="tthFrefABF">
  <sup>
   15
  </sup>
 </a>
 We pos­sess five com­plete Vinayas of the Sthavira group of schools, and only one from the Mahāsaṅghika. While all of these texts have many dif­fer­ences, schol­ars are agreed that the bulk of the im­por­tant ma­te­r­ial is shared by all the schools.
</p>
<p>
 One of the prin­ci­ples used in text-critical stud­ies is that when two re­lated texts share com­mon ma­te­r­ial, that ma­te­r­ial is most likely to de­rive from a com­mon an­ces­tor. Of course, this is not nec­es­sar­ily the case, as com­mon ma­te­r­ial may stem from later bor­row­ing or from par­al­lel but in­de­pen­dent de­vel­op­ments. Nevertheless, in most cases the the­sis of a shared an­ces­tor is the sim­plest and most pow­er­ful ex­pla­na­tion.
</p>
<p>
 All be­ing equal, then, if we find ma­te­r­ial in the five Sthavira Vinayas but not in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya, it is likely that the ma­te­r­ial in ques­tion was added by the Sthavira tra­di­tion fol­low­ing the first schism. And this is ex­actly the line of rea­son­ing that Ray re­lies on. Later we shall see, how­ever, that mat­ters are not so clear-cut, and that un­shared ma­te­r­ial might point to some­thing quite dif­fer­ent.
</p>
<p>
 All the Vinayas in­clude a sec­tion on schism. In the Sthavira group of schools, this sec­tion con­sists of a lengthy chap­ter in the part of the Vinaya called the Skandhaka.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABG" name="tthFrefABG">
  <sup>
   16
  </sup>
 </a>
 The Skandhaka con­sists of roughly twenty chap­ters that deal with var­i­ous mat­ters rang­ing from or­di­na­tion and dis­ci­pli­nary pro­ce­dures to build­ing stan­dards and de­port­ment. This is one of the main two di­vi­sions of the Sthavira Vinayas, the other be­ing the Vibhaṅga, which con­tains the rules for monks and nuns (
 <i>
  pāṭimokkha
 </i>
 ), to­gether with back­ground and ex­pla­na­tions. This di­vi­sion into two sec­tions, and the rough con­tent of the two sec­tions, is com­mon to all Vinayas. However, the Mahāsaṅghika sec­tion that Ray calls the Skandhaka is not re­ally com­pa­ra­ble to the Skandhakas found in the Sthavira Vinayas, de­spite the fact that they dis­cuss many of the same top­ics. More on this later.
</p>
<h3>
 The questions of Upāli
</h3>
<p>
 The  schism chap­ter of the Sthavira Skandhakas be­gins with a lengthy ac­count of Devadatta’s at­tempts to cause a schism in the Buddhist monas­tic com­mu­nity. After this is a briefer ex­change be­tween the Buddha and Upāli, the fore­most Vinaya ex­pert, on the topic of schism.
</p>
<p>
 Ray points out that the schism sec­tion in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya omits the story of Devadatta and con­sists only of a con­ver­sa­tion be­tween the Buddha and Upāli. He ar­gues that this must rep­re­sent an early ver­sion of the text, and that it was only later that the Sthavira schools con­nected Devadatta with schism. However, Ray’s dis­cus­sion is se­verely lack­ing. It would seem to be a mat­ter of some im­port that we have found the ear­li­est Vinaya ac­count of schism; yet he does not seem to have read the pas­sages in ques­tion; he does not con­sider the con­tent of them at all; he does not con­sider the genre of Vinaya lit­er­a­ture they be­long to; and he does not seek any grounds to in­de­pen­dently con­firm that this is, in fact, an early text. When these omis­sions are rec­ti­fied, we shall  see that Ray’s con­clu­sion is un­founded.
</p>
<p>
 The dis­cus­sion be­tween the Buddha and Upāli on schism is an ex­am­ple of a genre com­mon in all the Vinayas, known as the
 <i>
  up­āli­paripuc­chā
 </i>
 . It de­picts Venerable Upāli, the fore­most ex­pert on Vinaya, ap­proach­ing the Buddha with var­i­ous de­tailed and sys­tem­atic ques­tions on Vinaya. Such pas­sages are of­ten found to­wards the end of chap­ters in the Skandhaka; and in some schools, they were ex­tended to be­come com­plete Vinaya texts in them­selves. The ex­changes have a me­chan­i­cal, ar­ti­fi­cial qual­ity, far from the nat­ural dis­cus­sions of spir­i­tual life found in early Buddhism. They are never, as Ray says, the ‘core’ of the mat­ter (170); they are rather the Vinaya equiv­a­lent of the end­less cross-questions of the Abhidhamma, con­cerned with le­gal de­f­i­n­i­tions and cat­e­gor­i­cal niceties. The
 <i>
  up­āli­paripuc­chā
 </i>
 class of lit­er­a­ture, there­fore, be­longs to the later strata of canon­i­cal, and even post-canonical, text.
</p>
<p>
 Given the ubiq­uity of these dis­cus­sions, we can­not as­sume, as Ray does, that the
 <i>
  up­āli­paripuc­chās
 </i>
 on schism in the Sthavira and Mahāsaṅghika Vinayas stem from a com­mon an­ces­tor. Unless they share signs of a com­mon de­riva­tion, they may just as eas­ily have arisen as in­de­pen­dent par­al­lel de­vel­op­ments. Let us, then, com­pare the rel­e­vant pas­sages in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya with the Pali as an ex­am­ple of a Sthavira Vinaya.
</p>
<p>
 In the Pali, the dis­cus­sion be­gins with Upāli ask­ing about the dis­tinc­tion be­tween a ‘split in the Sangha’ (
 <i>
  saṅgharāji
 </i>
 ) and a ‘schism in the Sangha’ (
 <i>
  saṅghab­heda
 </i>
 ), as well as the one who brings har­mony to the Sangha.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABH" name="tthFrefABH">
  <sup>
   17
  </sup>
 </a>
 As usual in an
 <i>
  up­āli­paripuc­chā
 </i>
 , this is not an in­tro­duc­tion to the topic, but a clar­i­fi­ca­tion of le­gal de­f­i­n­i­tions that only makes sense to an ex­pert. The dis­cus­sion of­fers some verses,
 <a href="#tthFtNtABI" name="tthFrefABI">
  <sup>
   18
  </sup>
 </a>
 then pro­ceeds to ex­am­ine the ex­act con­di­tions whereby a schis­matic may or may not be des­tined to re­birth in hell. This only be­falls a monk who, with ma­li­cious in­tent to dis­tort the Dhamma and Vinaya, com­pletes a for­mal Act to di­vide the Sangha. While Devadatta is not men­tioned, this pas­sage ob­vi­ously de­rives from the fact that Devadatta was said to fall into hell fol­low­ing his at­tacks on the Buddha and his Sangha.
 <a href="#tthFtNtABJ" name="tthFrefABJ">
  <sup>
   19
  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Rather than the sin­gle ex­ten­sive dis­cus­sion found in the Pali, the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya con­tains two short sec­tions sep­a­rated by sev­eral pages. In the first of these sec­tions, the Buddha tells Upāli that one who causes schism may do so based on ei­ther mal­ice for the Dhamma or mal­ice for the per­son, and goes on to dis­cuss the num­ber of monks who make up a quo­rum for caus­ing a schism. It then dis­cusses the sit­u­a­tion if a ‘pow­er­ful lay fol­lower’ is in­volved.
 <a href="#tthFtNtACA" name="tthFrefACA">
  <sup>
   20
  </sup>
 </a>
 In the sec­ond sec­tion there is a brief dis­cus­sion of one who ei­ther breaks or brings har­mony to the Sangha, leav­ing out most of the de­tails of the Pali ac­count, such as the dis­tinc­tion be­tween the ‘split in the Sangha’ and the ‘schism in the Sangha’.
 <a href="#tthFtNtACB" name="tthFrefACB">
  <sup>
   21
  </sup>
 </a>
 Neither of these pas­sages fea­ture any verses.
</p>
<p>
 Unfortunately for Ray’s the­sis, the Mahāsaṅghika
 <i>
  up­āli­paripuc­chā
 </i>
 shares lit­tle in com­mon with the Pali pas­sages. A more de­tailed study, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the other Sthavira Vinayas, might re­veal some points in com­mon be­tween these texts. More likely the texts arose in­de­pen­dently, with sim­i­lar­i­ties due to the sim­ple fact that they adopt sim­i­lar lit­er­ary styles to ex­plain re­lated ba­sic texts. The men­tion of the ‘pow­er­ful lay fol­lower’ has been taken to re­fer to King Ashoka; if this is cor­rect, it con­firms the late­ness of the Mahāsaṅghika ver­sion. In any case, it is clear that the
 <i>
  up­āli­paripuc­chā
 </i>
 is not a com­mon core in the Vinaya treat­ment of schism.
</p>
<h3>
 Devadatta as schismatic in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya
</h3>
<p>
 Contrary to Ray’s claim that ‘there is no over­lap be­tween the Mahāsaṅghika treat­ment [of Devadatta] and that of the five [Sthavira] schools’ (170), the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya de­picts Devadatta as the ar­che­typal schis­matic, in much the same way as the Sthavira Vinayas. This pas­sage is found in the dis­cus­sion of the
 <i>
  pāṭimokkha
 </i>
 rule on schism.
 <a href="#tthFtNtACC" name="tthFrefACC">
  <sup>
   22
  </sup>
 </a>
 Devadatta ap­pears as a scoundrel try­ing to di­vide the Sangha, just as in all other Vinayas.
</p>
<p>
 The only rel­e­vant dif­fer­ence is the grounds he is said to base his at­tempt on. Whereas the Sthavira Vinayas say he pro­mul­gated a set of ‘five points’, by which he tried to en­force an ex­ces­sively as­cetic lifestyle on the monks, the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya omits the five points and at­trib­utes a much more com­pre­hen­sive agenda to him. He cor­rupted the en­tire cor­pus of Buddhist lit­er­a­ture, in­clud­ing the twelve su­tras,
 <a href="#tthFtNtACD" name="tthFrefACD">
  <sup>
   23
  </sup>
 </a>
 the var­i­ous cat­e­gories of Vinaya of­fences, and the nine class of scrip­ture (
 <i>
  aṅ­gas
 </i>
 ). Not only did he change the texts, he taught the monks to use a dif­fer­ent script and di­verse di­alects.
</p>
<p>
 This ac­count of Devadatta’s evil deeds is ob­vi­ously later than that found in the Sthavira Vinayas. Not only does the sheer length of the de­tails sug­gest this, but the whole tenor of the prob­lem has shifted from as­cetic lifestyle to tex­tual redac­tion. The di­ver­sity of di­alects is an is­sue that be­came a grow­ing prob­lem for Buddhism in the later pe­riod, as the Sangha moved across a wide range of the Indian sub­con­ti­nent. And, of course, the men­tion of writ­ing con­firms that this pas­sage is late. As usual, the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya, far from be­ing an early text, is later than the Pali and per­haps other Sthavira Vinayas.
</p>
<p>
 Ray is aware of this pas­sage (171–172), and ac­knowl­edges that it is much the same as the ac­count found in the Sthavira Vinayas, say­ing, ‘All the ver­sions ac­cord ma­jor re­spon­si­bil­ity for the di­vi­sion in the com­mu­nity to Devadatta.’ (171) One would imag­ine that, since this is a cen­tral text that di­rectly con­tra­dicts Ray’s ba­sic the­sis, he would have a solid ar­gu­ment for why this pas­sage is to be dis­re­garded. Surprisingly, there is no such ar­gu­ment. All he says is this:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  … [Bareau] does not assume—as does Mukherjee—that the Vibhaṅga ver­sion is the ear­lier. Unlike Mukherjee, Bareau be­gins his analy­sis with the leg­end of the schism as it ap­pears in the Skandhaka, as the more au­then­tic ear­lier ver­sion. Bareau’s ar­gu­ment makes good sense, among other rea­sons be­cause the Vibhaṅga ver­sion clearly leaves the story of the schism in­com­plete and dangling—in or­der to in­ter­ject the rule that this story is sup­posed to have provoked—whereas the Skandhaka ac­count gives the story in a dra­mat­i­cally com­plete form.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 So, of the two stud­ies on which Ray re­lies, Mukherjee takes the Vibhaṅga ac­count to be the ear­lier, while Bareau takes the Skandhaka to be ear­lier. This dis­agree­ment is hardly re­as­sur­ing. Leaving aside what Ray un­help­fully refers to as ‘other rea­sons’, the only ac­tual ar­gu­ment he gives for pre­fer­ring Bareau’s po­si­tion over Mukherjee is that the Skandhaka ac­count gives a more com­plete nar­ra­tive, while the Vibhaṅga only in­cludes a trun­cated ac­count as nec­es­sary back­ground for the rule.
</p>
<p>
 This, how­ever, is no rea­son at all. It is far more likely that the nar­ra­tive of the Buddha’s life was orig­i­nally told as iso­lated in­ci­dents, anec­dotes shared among the com­mu­nity, which were grad­u­ally gath­ered and arranged into a com­plete leg­end, one chap­ter of which con­cerned Devadatta. This is how all sto­ries are told; they don’t start out as fully-formed bi­ogra­phies, such as that found in the Skandhaka. They evolve from bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
 In the early pe­riod, the Sangha would have been fa­mil­iar with the story of Devadatta. It would have been hot gos­sip in the com­mu­nity, so there’d be no need to spell the whole story out in every con­text. After the Buddha’s death, how­ever, as the com­mu­nity moved on and mem­o­ries grew dim, the need for a com­pre­hen­sive ac­count as found in the Skandhaka would be­come press­ing. There is, there­fore, no rea­son to be­lieve that the Skandhaka ac­count is ear­lier sim­ply on the ba­sis that it is fuller. On the con­trary, this very fact sug­gests that it can­not be early.
</p>
<p>
 The Vibhaṅga treats schism un­der a
 <i>
  pāṭimokkha
 </i>
 rule (
 <i>
  saṅghādis­esa
 </i>
 10) for one ag­i­tat­ing for a schism. This is a se­ri­ous of­fence that’s meant to de­ter any­one from try­ing to cause a schism, or to sup­port one who is caus­ing a schism. The Vibhaṅga ac­count, how­ever, is in­com­plete. It does not de­scribe what to do if the de­ter­rent doesn’t work and a group of Sangha go ahead to cause a schism any­way. This topic is taken up in the Skandhaka, which de­scribes the ex­act le­gal de­f­i­n­i­tion of a schism in de­tail, how it may be healed, and so on. This is why the Vibhaṅga ac­count does not in­clude the full nar­ra­tive of Devadatta. It has noth­ing to do with a gen­er­al­ized as­sump­tion of the rel­a­tive age or au­then­tic­ity of the Vibhaṅga over the Skandhakas or vice verse. Rather, it fol­lows di­rectly from the pur­pose and func­tion of the two texts, which are or­ga­nized as an in­ter­de­pen­dent whole.

<p>
 This mis­take is dev­as­tat­ing to Ray’s ar­gu­ment. His whole case rests on the ar­gu­ment that the ab­sence of Devadatta from the Mahāsaṅghika Skandhaka in­di­cates that it was a later ad­di­tion. This ar­gu­ment is false.
</p>
<p>
 But Ray’s prob­lems do not end there, for Devadatta does in fact ap­pear as a schis­matic in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya in the por­tions that are par­al­lel to the Sthavira Skandhakas. There is a short para­graph de­pict­ing an episode of the Devadatta story, sim­i­lar to that found in the Sthavira Vinayas. It de­scribes how, in­tent on caus­ing a schism, he took 500 monks away with him, and the dis­cus­sion be­tween the Buddha and Ānanda on this prob­lem.

 </a>
 Ray over­looks this pas­sage, which un­der­mines his en­tire the­sis.
</p>
<p>
 There are, in con­clu­sion, two pas­sages in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya that de­pict Devadatta as the ar­che­typal schis­matic. These episodes are sub­stan­tially sim­i­lar to the de­pic­tions found in the Sthavira Vinayas, and where they dif­fer, the Mahāsaṅghika is later. These two pas­sages cor­re­spond with the sec­tions that Mukherjee iden­ti­fied as episodes 13 and 14 of Devadatta’s story—the grounds for the schism and the schism it­self. Ray ig­nores one of these pas­sages, and dis­misses the other on grounds that are both flimsy and false. Ray’s mis­take is far from in­ci­den­tal; it is the core of his the­sis.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  The fact that the Devadatta leg­end, in­clud­ing its core (episodes 13 and 14) and its elab­o­ra­tion (episodes 1 to 12 and 15), is com­mon to the
  <i>
   vinayas
  </i>
  of the five schools de­riv­ing from the Sthavira but not found in the Mahāsāṅghika
  <i>
   vinaya
  </i>
  sug­gests that the leg­end arose among the Sthaviras, af­ter they split from the Mahāsāṅghika in the fourth cen­tury  BCE.

    26
   </sup>
  </a>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 When Ray’s er­rors are cor­rected, the same logic leads to the op­po­site con­clu­sion. The fact that the Devadatta leg­end, at least the core episodes 13 and 14, is com­mon to all six Vinayas in­clud­ing the Mahāsaṅghika sug­gests the leg­end arose among the pre­sec­tar­ian com­mu­nity, and in all like­li­hood harks back to the time of the Buddha him­self.
</p>
<h3>
 Narrative in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya
</h3>
<p>
 This leaves open the ques­tion of the re­main­ing episodes of Devadatta’s leg­end, which are in­deed ab­sent from the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya. Perhaps these elab­o­ra­tions are the prod­uct of the Sthavira schools fol­low­ing the schism. Indeed, the in­her­ent im­plau­si­bil­ity of many of these episodes, as well as the vari­a­tions in the tra­di­tions, make it cer­tain that they were sub­ject to a de­gree of elab­o­ra­tion.
</p>
<p>
 However, even this weak­ened ver­sion of Ray’s the­sis fails. The ab­sence of elab­o­rated nar­ra­tive does not in­di­cate that the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya is early. It is merely a lit­er­ary fea­ture of the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya, which reg­u­larly re­moves nar­ra­tive ma­te­r­ial.
</p>
<p>
 While all the Vinayas con­tain some nar­ra­tives which serve to il­lu­mi­nate the dis­ci­pli­nary code, there was a marked ten­dency to add more and more, un­til the dis­ci­pli­nary mat­ter was al­most buried un­der lay­ers of in­creas­ingly elab­o­rate sto­ry­telling. The most ex­treme ex­am­ple of this ten­dency is the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya. The redac­tors of the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya took the op­po­site road, re­mov­ing most lengthy nar­ra­tives and fo­cussing on the le­gal as­pects. Presumably the nar­ra­tives were col­lected else­where, per­haps in a quasi-Vinaya col­lec­tion of leg­ends such as the Mahāsaṅghika’s own Mahāvastu.
</p>
<p>
 There are many ex­am­ples of this. Several of the Vinayas in­clude part or whole of the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta. In the Mahāsaṅghika, this novel-length text is sum­ma­rized in a few lines, be­gin­ning with King Ajātasattu’s ha­tred for the Vajjians, and in­di­cat­ing that the en­tire text be filled in up to the time the Buddha lay down be­tween the twin
 <i>
  sal
 </i>
 trees.
 <a href="#tthFtNtACH" name="tthFrefACH">

 </a>
 Clearly the text is ab­bre­vi­at­ing an ear­lier ver­sion that con­tained the full story.
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes we ac­tu­ally have the full ver­sion of the text that is ab­bre­vi­ated in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya. This is be­cause there ex­ists a par­tial Vinaya of the Lokuttaravāda school, who are a branch of the Mahāsaṅghikas. This Vinaya is very sim­i­lar to the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya, ex­cept that it ex­pands nar­ra­tives that are ab­bre­vi­ated in the Chinese Mahāsaṅghika text. So, for ex­am­ple, when the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya says, ‘All should be told as in the Seven Women Sutra’,
 <a href="#tthFtNtACI" name="tthFrefACI">

 In some cases, the redac­tion of nar­ra­tive from the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya has led schol­ars down mis­taken by­ways. So, for ex­am­ple, Jan Nattier ar­gued that the Mahāsaṅghikas did not have a ver­sion of the re­quest of the Buddha’s step­mother Mahāpajāpatī for or­di­na­tion.
 <a href="#tthFtNtADA" name="tthFrefADA">

 </a>
 She con­cluded, us­ing par­al­lel logic to Ray, that this im­plied that the story was in­vented by the Sthaviras af­ter the first schism. She ne­glected, how­ever, to take into ac­count the Lokuttaravāda Vinaya, which does in­clude the story.
 <a href="#tthFtNtADB" name="tthFrefADB">
  <sup>
   31
  </sup>
 </a>
 Indeed, when ex­am­ined closely, the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya in­di­cates that the story has been elided, in­struct­ing that it should be told in full.
 <a href="#tthFtNtADC" name="tthFrefADC">
  <sup>

  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 In all these cases we are wit­ness­ing, not a gen­uine sec­tar­ian di­ver­gence, but a mere lit­er­ary fea­ture of the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya: it omits most nar­ra­tive. Such is the case, also, with the story of Devadatta. It re­quires no fur­ther ex­pla­na­tion.
</p>
<h3>
 Does the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya even have a Skandhaka?
</h3>
<p>
 The prob­lems with Ray’s analy­sis go even deeper than this. It seems that the sec­tion of the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya that Ray treats as the Skandhaka is not a Skandhaka at all. To un­der­stand this, we have to re­view some of the mod­ern schol­arly work on the Vinaya.
</p>
<p>
 The most de­tailed com­par­a­tive analy­sis of the Skandhakas is that of Frauwallner. He ar­gued that all the Skandhakas stemmed from a com­mon an­ces­tor, and were char­ac­ter­ized by a struc­tured ap­proach to Vinaya top­ics, em­bed­ded within the ear­li­est large-scale bi­og­ra­phy of the Buddha. His analy­sis was a pow­er­ful in­sight into the shared struc­ture of the Sthavira Vinayas, but he strug­gled to rec­on­cile these with the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya, con­clud­ing that it had been sub­ject to a ma­jor later re­struc­tur­ing.
 <a href="#tthFtNtADD" name="tthFrefADD">
  <sup>
   33
  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 More re­cently Shayne Clarke has ar­gued per­sua­sively that what Frauwallner had iden­ti­fied as the Mahāsaṅghika Skandhaka bears a much closer re­la­tion to an en­tirely sep­a­rate class of Vinaya lit­er­a­ture, known as the
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 . Thus while all the Sthavira Vinayas con­sist of the Vibhaṅga plus the Skandhaka (and some sup­ple­men­tary ma­te­r­ial), the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya con­sists of the Vibhaṅga plus the
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If we ac­cept Clarke’s ar­gu­ment, as it seems we must, Ray’s point be­comes even less per­ti­nent. There is noth­ing sur­pris­ing in the fact that the story of Devadatta is ab­sent from the Mahāsaṅghika Skandhaka, be­cause it isn’t a Skandhaka at all. He is com­par­ing ap­ples with or­anges. We could take up just about any fea­ture of the Sthavira Skandhakas, es­pe­cially the nar­ra­tive por­tions, and show that they are ab­sent or very dif­fer­ent in the Mahāsaṅghika. This proves noth­ing ex­cept that these texts are not all that closely re­lated.
</p>
<p>
 We should in­stead com­pare the rel­e­vant sec­tion of the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya with the other texts iden­ti­fied as Vinaya
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 (of which there are four, ac­cord­ing to Clarke).
 <a href="#tthFtNtADE" name="tthFrefADE">
  <sup>

 </a>
 A cur­sory sur­vey of the rel­e­vant Sarvāstivāda and Haimavata texts in Chinese re­veals that the Haimavata Vinaya

 has a para­graph deal­ing with Devadatta’s five points,
 <a href="#tthFtNtADF" name="tthFrefADF">
  <sup>
   35
  </sup>
 </a>
 but noth­ing more than this. This is no sur­prise, since they are a strictly le­gal­is­tic type of text. It is the Skandhaka that uni­fied ju­rispru­dence and nar­ra­tive, and there is no rea­son for the
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 s to in­clude any such ma­te­r­ial.
</p>
<p>
 While it seems clear enough that the Mahāsaṅghika
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 is closely re­lated to other Vinaya
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 texts, the im­pli­ca­tions of this are less clear, and are left open by Clarke. It is pos­si­ble that they com­prise an ear­lier type of text than the Skandhaka, clas­si­fy­ing much of the same kind of ma­te­r­ial in a more bare-bones way. It is equally pos­si­ble that they are a par­al­lel de­vel­op­ment, or a later reshuf­fling of ma­te­r­ial.
</p>
<p>
 Even if the Vinaya
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 s (in­clud­ing the Mahāsaṅghika) are an ear­lier form of Vinaya lit­er­a­ture, this does not im­ply that the Devadatta story in the Sthavira Vinayas is late. It just means that the Devadatta story was added to the Skandhaka at this later date.
 <a href="#tthFtNtADG" name="tthFrefADG">
  <sup>
   36
  </sup>
 </a>
 There is noth­ing ex­cep­tional about this, since all the nar­ra­tive ma­te­r­ial was added at this time. This tells us noth­ing about when the ma­te­r­ial was cre­ated.
</p>
<p>
 Be that as it may, I find no rea­son to think that the
 <i>
  mātikā
 </i>
 s are ear­lier than the canon­i­cal Vinayas. They are an Abhivinaya style of sys­tem­atic sum­mary, and I sus­pect that more sober analy­sis will con­clude that they are, on the whole, de­riv­a­tive of other canon­i­cal ma­te­r­ial.

<h3>
 Devadatta in other Mahāsaṅghika texts
</h3>
<p>
 If Ray is to be be­lieved, Devadatta was a for­est as­cetic, who was vil­i­fied in the Sthavira group of schools as part of the deca­dent ten­dency of monas­tic Buddhism. If this were the case, one might ex­pect that the Mahāsaṅghikas would proudly pre­serve the au­then­tic, saintly Devadatta as part of their tra­di­tion. But this is not what we find at all.
</p>
<p>
 As we have seen, the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya it­self in­cludes an ac­count of Devadatta’s schis­matic ef­forts that is even later than the ver­sion in the Sthavira Vinayas. In ad­di­tion, the episode where he leads 500 monks astray is re­counted. But these are not the only dis­parag­ing men­tions of Devadatta in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya. The
 <i>
  vib­haṅga
 </i>
 to bhikkhuni
 <i>
  pācit­tiya
 </i>
 87 gives a num­ber of ex­am­ples of oaths that a bhikkhuni should not make. These in­clude an oath to the ef­fect that she be charged with a crime like that of Devadatta.
 <a href="#tthFtNtADI" name="tthFrefADI">
  <sup>
   38
  </sup>
 </a>
 This as­sumes that we know who Devadatta is, and that he is a vil­lain.
</p>
<p>
 We also find Devadatta in his ne­far­i­ous role in the Ekottara Āgama, which is usu­ally at­trib­uted to the Mahāsaṅghikas.
 <a href="#tthFtNtADJ" name="tthFrefADJ">
  <sup>
   39
  </sup>
 </a>
 While this at­tri­bu­tion is un­cer­tain, it at least sug­gests that the Mahāsaṅghikas, fol­low­ing the ex­am­ple found in their Vinaya, dis­par­aged Devadatta no less than other schools.
</p>
<p>
 We are on firmer ground in the Mahāvastu, a Mahāsaṅghika ver­sion of the life of the Buddha. Here, as in all other ver­sions of the Buddha’s life, Devadatta ap­pears as the vil­lain, and is mocked and hu­mil­i­ated in his var­i­ous evil en­deav­ours in past lives as well as this life.
 <a href="#tthFtNtAEA" name="tthFrefAEA">
  <sup>
   40
  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 So it’s clear that Devadatta was the bad guy for the Mahāsaṅghikas just as in the Sthavira schools. This is the case from the early canon­i­cal texts (Vinaya, Ekottara) through to the later leg­ends (Mahāvastu). Ray of­fers no ex­pla­na­tion for why the Mahāsaṅghikas would so lightly dis­card one of their early saints.
</p>
<h3>
 The historical survival of Devadatta’s community
</h3>
<p>
 Ray con­tin­ues his ar­gu­ment by stat­ing (174): ‘There can be no doubt that Devadatta’s schism is not an event imag­ined by Buddhist au­thors, but is a his­toric fact, as shown by the ev­i­dence pro­vided by the two Chinese pil­grims, Fa-hsien and Hsuan-tsen.’
</p>
<p>
 Such cer­tainty is al­ways a red flag in a his­tor­i­cal re­con­struc­tion. Descriptions of things that hap­pened 2500 years ago are rarely, if ever, so bor­ingly de­void of am­bi­gu­ity, and cer­ti­tude re­veals only the pres­ence of dogma. There are any num­ber of rea­sons why the ac­counts of the Fa-xian and Xuan-zang need not im­ply that Devadatta suc­cess­fully es­tab­lished a long-term spir­i­tual move­ment.
</p>
<p>
 But what do these ac­counts ac­tu­ally say? Xuan-zang, as well as record­ing many of the usual neg­a­tive sto­ries of Devadatta, men­tions that in the Aṅga re­gion of India ‘there are three monas­ter­ies in which they do not use thick­ened milk, fol­low­ing the di­rec­tions of Devadatta.’
 <a href="#tthFtNtAEB" name="tthFrefAEB">
  <sup>
   41
  </sup>
 </a>
 This doesn’t show that there was a com­mu­nity with any his­tor­i­cal link with Devadatta, merely that some monas­tics were fol­low­ing one of the rules Devadatta had pro­mul­gated.
 <a href="#tthFtNtAEC" name="tthFrefAEC">
  <sup>
   42
  </sup>
 </a>
 To this day, if a re­form group in Theravāda ad­vo­cates veg­e­tar­i­an­ism, they will be dis­parag­ingly dis­missed as ‘dis­ci­ples of Devadatta’. Most likely the groups Xuan-zang re­ferred to were some­thing of the sort.
</p>
<p>
 Fa-xian is more def­i­nite, say­ing that: ‘There are also com­pa­nies of the fol­low­ers of Devadatta still ex­ist­ing. They reg­u­larly make of­fer­ings to the three pre­vi­ous Buddhas, but not to Sakyamuni Buddha.’
 <a href="#tthFtNtAED" name="tthFrefAED">
  <sup>
   43
  </sup>
 </a>
 Without con­text, it is hard to know what this im­plies. A few lines fur­ther on, the text men­tions that stu­pas for the birth­places of three pre­vi­ous Buddhas were found in the vicin­ity. This ex­plains why they were wor­shipped there, but not why this was con­nected with Devadatta.
</p>
<p>
 It is, of course, quite pos­si­ble that Fa-xian sim­ply made a mis­take. It does seem rather odd that none of the Indian Buddhist texts men­tion a sect of Devadatta’s fol­low­ers. There are hun­dreds of pages in Buddhist texts de­voted to re­fut­ing both Buddhist and non-Buddhist here­sies; so why did no-one so much as re­fer in pass­ing to the Devadatta group? It’s hard to set up a spir­i­tual or­der, and ex­tremely un­usual for one to last af­ter the founder’s death. In all the sprawl­ing com­plex­ity of Indian re­li­gion, there are only three or four na­tive re­li­gious or­ders that have man­aged to last. How is it that a ma­jor de­vel­op­ment passed down for a thou­sand years with only a cou­ple of pass­ing ref­er­ences in the jour­nals of for­eign trav­ellers?
</p>
<p>
 I could go on with other prob­lems, but this is suf­fi­cient to show that Ray’s claim that the sur­vival of Devadatta’s schis­matic group is ‘no doubt’ a ‘his­toric fact’ is un­ten­able. The ca­sual, pass­ing ref­er­ences by the Chinese pil­grims are in­deed in­trigu­ing, and in­vite sev­eral in­ter­est­ing in­ter­pre­ta­tions. No in­ter­pre­ta­tion, how­ever, can of­fer the cer­tainty that Ray as­serts.
</p>
<p>
 Ray makes a ba­sic mis­take here. He starts out by con­tra­dict­ing the en­tire cor­pus of early lit­er­a­ture, in­clud­ing the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya, which de­picts Devadatta as a ma­li­cious schis­matic who ended in fail­ure. He then takes a cou­ple of lines writ­ten
 <i>
  a thou­sand years later
 </i>
 as ab­solute ev­i­dence for a his­tor­i­cal re­al­ity in the time of the Buddha. This is not his­tory, it’s fan­tasy.
</p>
<h3>
 Devadatta’s redemption
</h3>
<p>
 Ray’s fi­nal ar­gu­ment brings us to the ap­pear­ance of Devadatta in the Māhāyana Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra, bet­ter known as the Lotus Sutra (175–6). There, the Buddha is de­picted as telling a past life story of Devadatta as a for­est sage, prais­ing Devadatta, who is part of the as­sem­bly of monks, and then pre­dict­ing that he would be­come a Buddha in the far dis­tant fu­ture. There is no men­tion of Devadatta’s fall from grace.
</p>
<p>
 Ray, while ac­knowl­edg­ing the late­ness of this text, won­ders whether this ac­count might ‘re­tain a tra­di­tion re­lat­ing to this saint that an­te­dates or is con­tem­po­ra­ne­ous with his vil­i­fi­ca­tion in the var­i­ous vinayas?’ The sec­tion of the Lotus Sutra that in­cludes this story (Chapter 11) is dated
 <i>
  circa
 </i>
 200  CE, that is, 600 years or so af­ter the Buddha. The text as a whole is one of the most fan­tas­ti­cally imag­i­na­tive of all the Buddhist scrip­tures. To re­gard this kind of story as in any way con­nected with a gen­uine his­tory of the Buddha’s time is pre­pos­ter­ous.

 This de­pic­tion of Devadatta, more­over, con­tains lit­tle that is not found in the early schools. We al­ready know that Devadatta, while he was still a monk of good stand­ing, was praised for his med­i­ta­tive prowess and psy­chic pow­ers. There are Jātaka sto­ries in Pali that de­pict Devadatta as an as­cetic in past lives, al­beit a cor­rupt one.

 As I ex­plained at the start of this es­say, it is es­sen­tial that he de­vel­oped good qual­i­ties in the past in or­der to have the power he pos­sesses in the present.
</p>
<p>
 And the no­tion that Devadatta will be re­deemed and at­tain Awakening in the fu­ture is com­mon, and was prob­a­bly a uni­ver­sally held be­lief among Buddhists then, as to­day. Ray notes that of the canon­i­cal Vinayas only the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya in­cludes a leg­end that Devadatta will be­come Awakened. But this is to be ex­pected. Just as the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya leaves out most leg­end, the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya puts it in. Stories and leg­ends con­tained in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya are of­ten found in the other tra­di­tions, but in their com­men­tar­ial or other lit­er­a­ture, not in the canons. And that is pre­cisely the case here, for the post-canonical Theravāda texts proph­esy that Devadatta will in the far dis­tant fu­ture be­come the Paccekabuddha Aṭṭhissara.

 This, too, is an es­sen­tial part of his story, re­quired by the fun­da­men­tals of Buddhist doc­trine. No bad kamma lasts for­ever, and even the most evil per­son is ca­pa­ble of re­demp­tion.
</p>
<h3>
 Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
 Ray’s the­sis that Devadatta was a for­est saint who was un­fairly vil­i­fied by later monas­tic Buddhists is base­less. The read­ings on which he re­lies are ei­ther mis­taken or wrongly in­ter­preted. This is not a mat­ter of sub­jec­tive judge­ment; he just gets his texts wrong. When his mis­takes are cor­rected it all falls apart.
</p>
<p>
 Devadatta was a promis­ing young monk, a tal­ented rel­a­tive of the Buddha, who fell prey to the all-too-human weak­nesses of jeal­ousy and con­ceit. His fall from grace was dra­matic, but there was still the hope of re­demp­tion. This story is told con­sis­tently through all the Buddhist tra­di­tions. Like all the pop­u­lar episodes in the Buddha’s life, it has been sub­ject to all man­ner of ex­ag­ger­a­tion. In this process, the his­tor­i­cal fig­ure of Devadatta has be­come ob­scured as if by a deep fog. The meth­ods of tex­tual crit­i­cism of­fer some hope in dis­tin­guish­ing the more or less plau­si­ble as­pects of his leg­end, and giv­ing a glimpse of the man be­hind the leg­end.
</p>
<p>
 In Ray’s hands, how­ever, this glimpse is lost and we are left with just an­other car­i­ca­ture. In place of the car­toon­ish vil­lain of the tra­di­tions, so hope­lessly fool­ish and doomed, we have an equally car­toon­ish hero, a flaw­less re­al­ized saint, trag­i­cally mis­un­der­stood, whose every fail­ing is ar­bi­trar­ily at­trib­uted to the crooked mo­ti­va­tions of monas­tic pro­pa­gan­dists. The
 <em>
  life
 </em>
 of Devadatta―his com­plex, nu­anced, elu­sive, frag­ile, tor­mented soul―is still hid­den.
