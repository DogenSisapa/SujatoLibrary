 The Pali
 <em>
  veḷuriya
 </em>
 is etymologically related to the English beryl.

  <p>
   Beryl is a mineral composed of beryllium aluminium cyclosilicate with the chemical formula Be3Al2(SiO3)6. Well-known varieties of beryl include emerald and aquamarine. Naturally occurring, hexagonal crystals of beryl can be up to several meters in size, but terminated crystals are relatively rare. Pure beryl is colorless, but it is frequently tinted by impurities; possible colors are green, blue, yellow, red (the rarest), and white.   The name "beryl" is derived (via Latin: beryllus, Old French: ...

 However, despite the obvious historical connection, it is often translated and defined in dictionaries as lapis lazuli.

    Lapis lazuli

  </h3>
  <p>
   Lapis lazuli (/ˈlæpɪs ˈlæzjuːli/, /-ˈlæzjuːlaɪ/), or lapis for short, is a deep blue metamorphic rock used as a semi-precious stone that has been prized since antiquity for its intense color. As early as the 7th millennium BC, lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines, in Shortugai, and in other mines in Badakhshan province in northeast Afghanistan. Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (3300–1900 BC). Lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh, the At th...

 However, this seems to be a mistake. Lapis lazuli is described by its intense blue hue and dull luster, neither of which are characteristic of
 <em>
  veḷuriya
 </em>
 . Rather,
 <em>
  veḷuriya
 </em>
 is described as transparent, gleaming, and shining, which sounds much more like beryl. So in this case, the obvious translation is the correct one.
</p>
<p>
 The connection with lapis lazuli appears to be based on Ja 32, where it is the color of a peacock’s neck. But beryl may be blue, and this could be referring to an emerald or sapphire; or else the term could just be vague. Regardless, the main references in the EBTs do not agree with the identification as lapis lazuli.

 There’s a few Pali words for walls and similar structures, and it is worth sorting them out.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Pākāra
  </strong>
  : This is an encircling barrier for a town or city, and is sometimes translated as “fence” or else “embankment”. But a fence is usually a flimsy construction of wire or posts, while
  <em>
   pākāra
  </em>
  is made of brick, stone, or wood. It’s most commonly found in the description of psychic powers, as one of the things you can go right through. But growing up in Perth, getting through a fence was an after-school diversion, not an amazing power! On the other hand, it’s said to be something that you can listen through (AN 7.50), or dump urine over (
  <a href="https://suttacentral.net/en/pi-tv-bi-vb-pc8">
   Bi Pc 8
  </a>
  ), so “embankment” is probably not right either. The precise term is “rampart”.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Kuṭṭa
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   kuḍḍa
  </strong>
  : this means “wall”. Like
  <em>
   pākāra
  </em>
  , it may be made of brick, stone, or wood, so it was a substantial construction, which again is borne out by the fact that you need psychic powers to get through it. The commentaries say it means the wall of a house (
  <em>
   geha-bhittiyā
  </em>
  ). But we also have the phrase
  <em>
   tirokuḍḍa
  </em>
  in the sense “outside the wall”. So it seems that, while
  <em>
   pākāra
  </em>
  was a rampart encircling the town, the
  <em>
   kuḍḍa
  </em>
  was the exterior wall of a house, or possibly a wall surrounding a house. The PTS dictionary’s idea that it is a simple wall of wattle and daub doesn’t seem justified.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Bhitti
  </strong>
  : This is the most general term for the wall of a house or building. It probably means something like “partition”, and may often have been a less substantial barrier.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Uddāpa
  </strong>
  : This is a more specialized term, part of the fortifications for a citadel. It is mentioned before
  <em>
   pākāra
  </em>
  , and the commentary says it is the  foundation of a
  <em>
   pākāra
  </em>
  (
  <em>
   pākāra-vatthu
  </em>
  ). Thus it seems it was a dug mound of earth upon which was built a rampart. “Embankment” works fine for this.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Vati
  </strong>
  : According to PTS dict, this means “fence”. However, it doesn’t appear to occur in the EBTs and I haven’t investigated it further.
 </li>
</ul>
