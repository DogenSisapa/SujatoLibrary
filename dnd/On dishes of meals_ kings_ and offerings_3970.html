 There is a set of terms that is used in a fairly specific set of circumstances in the Pali, yet so far translations have not quite captured them. They refer to the offering of food, and are restricted to the upper classes of society. The terms also overlap with the terminology of the Vedic sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
 The first term is
 <em>
  thālipāka
 </em>
 , literally “a dish of cooked (food)”.
</p>
<p>
 In AN 3.59 we have:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   assassu, bho gotama, yañño vā saddhaṃ vā
   <strong>
    thālipāko
   </strong>
   vā deyyadhammaṃ vā, tevijjesu brāhmaṇesu dānaṃ dadeyyā
  </em>
  <br/>
  “Master Gotama, whoever has a sacrifice, an offering of food for ancestors,
  <strong>
   a dish of milk-rice prepared for an auspicious ceremony
  </strong>
  , or a gift to give, should give it to the brahmins who have mastered the three Vedic knowledges.”
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 My rendering follows the Sanskrit dictionary, which gives “a dish of barley or rice boiled in milk (used as an oblation)” for
 <a href="http://sanskritdictionary.com/sth%C4%81l%C4%ABp%C4%81ka/274107/1">
  <em>
   sthālīpāka
  </em>
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Elsewhere in the Pali we find
 <em>
  thālipāka
 </em>
 used in the context of the sacrifice, showing this is no mere coincidence (DN 3, MN 93).
</p>
<p>
 Apart from these contexts, the term is invariably used in the context of the upper classes of society: kings, or aristocrats such as Anāthapiṇḍika or the Licchavis. It’s either the dish of food that they are eating (MN 126, SN 55.26) or which is offered by them to ascetics (SN 17.36, MN 35). In such contexts, the magnificence of the offering is clearly implied; for example, SN 17.36 speaks of the decadent luxury by which Ajātasattu corrupted Devadatta.
</p>
<p>
 In such contexts,
 <em>
  thālipāka
 </em>
 is used together with another term,
 <em>
  abhihāra
 </em>
 , especially
 <em>
  bhattabhihāra
 </em>
 . This basically means “offering (of food)”, but it is restricted to such formal, elevated settings. The formalism is accentuated by the prefix
 <em>
  abhi-
 </em>
 , and by the fact that the term is often used in repetitive idioms, where the extravagence and excess of the offering is emphasized (eg. Pj 1:
 <em>
  saṭṭhimatte thālipāke bhattābhihāraṃ abhihariṃsu
 </em>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 It’s not impossible that these two senses are the same, as implied by Ven Bodhi in his translation of MN 35, where he has: “ceremonial dishes of milk-rice”. In a parallel idiom at SN 17.36 he has simply “an offering of food”.
</p>
<p>
 However, given how generic the term
 <em>
  thālipāka
 </em>
 is, it is more likely that it is a general term for food presented to royals and aristocrats, and used in a more specialized sense in the context of the sacrifice. Hence at DN 17 and SN 22.96, the
 <em>
  thālipāka
 </em>
 is the only food served to the king, and he was said to have eaten at most a single serve of rice and sauce (
 <em>
  nāḷikodanaparamaṃ bhuñjāmi tadupiyañca sūpeyyaṃ
 </em>
 ). It is also more reasonable to think that large, extravagant offerings of food to ascetics would include something other than milk-rice.
</p>
<p>
 So we have a term for food in general, but restricted to elevated settings. We should attempt to render the idioms in an elevated, formal style.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Tena kho pana samayena devadattassa ajātasattukumāro pañcahi rathasatehi sāyaṃ pātaṃ upaṭṭhānaṃ gacchati, pañca ca thālipākasatāni bhattābhihāro abhiharīyati.
  </em>
  <br/>
  Now at that time Prince Ajātasattu was going in the morning and the evening to attend on Devadatta with five hundred carts, presenting him with an offering of five hundred servings of food.
