  In a previous discussion
 </a>
 I said that Uddaka’s saying criticized by the Buddha in
 <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato">
  DN 29
 </a>
 , “one sees but does not see”, referring to a razor’s edge, is reminiscent of Upanishadic teachings about the imminent Self.
</p>
<p>
 I’ve just tracked down what I believe to be the specific source for this:
 <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117939.html">
  Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.7
 </a>
 .

<blockquote>
 <p>
  This (universe) was then undifferentiated. It differentiated only into name and form—it was called such and such, and was of such and such form. So to this day it is differentiated only into name and form—it is called such and such, and is of such and such form. This Self has entered into these bodies up to the tip of the nails—as a razor may be put in its case, or as fire, which sustains the world, may be in its source. People do not see It, for (viewed in Its aspects) It is incomplete. When It does the function of living, It is called the vital force; when It speaks, the organ of speech; when It sees, the eye; when It hears, the ear; and when It thinks, the mind. These are merely Its names according to functions. He who meditates upon each of this totality of aspects does not know, for It is incomplete, (being divided) from this totality by possessing a single characteristic. The Self alone is to be meditated upon, for all these are unified in It. Of all these, this Self alone should be realised, for one knows all these through It, just as one may get (an animal) through its footprints. He who knows It as such obtains fame and association (with his relatives).

<p>
 The Self is hidden like a razor in its case. People “see” the functions or attributes of the Self, but they do “not see” (
 <em>
  na paśyanti
 </em>
 ) the Self as the whole underlying these aspects. The occurrence of the specific idea of the razor that is not seen, and the Self that is seen but not seen, are too precise to be a coincidence.  This confirms that not only was Uddaka a Brahmanical rishi, but that he was familiar with this specific passage.
