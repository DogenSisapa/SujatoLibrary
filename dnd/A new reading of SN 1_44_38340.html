  <h1>A new reading of SN 1.44</h1>

  <p>
 SN 1.44 is one of those delightful suttas that offers a riddle with no solution. Ven Bodhi translates it:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  The seer has crossed over the abyss
  <br/>
  With its one root, two whirlpools,
  <br/>
  Three stains, five extensions,
  <br/>
  An ocean with twelve eddies.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 And gives the following note:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Spk explains the riddle thus: The ocean (samudda) or abyss (pātāla) is craving, called an ocean because it is unfillable and an abyss because it gives no foothold. Its one root (ekamūla) is ignorance; the two whirlpools (dvirāvaṭṭa) are the views of eternalism and annihilationism. [Spk-pṭ: Craving for existence revolves by way of the eternalist view; craving for extermination by way of the annihilationist view.] The three stains (timala) are lust, hatred, and delusion; the five extensions (pañcapatthara), the five cords of sensual pleasure; and the twelve eddies (dvādasāvaṭṭa), the six internal and external sense bases. Ñāṇananda proposes an alternative interpretation of some of these terms: with reference to 36:4, he takes the abyss to be painful feeling, and with reference to 35:228, the ocean to be the six sense faculties. The two whirlpools are pleasant and painful feeling; the one root, contact. For details see SN-Anth 2:63-66.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Given the open-ended nature of the text, it would be foolish to propose that there is only one solution. Yet I suspect that all these sources have overlooked a singular feature, and when that is incorporated, it affects not just the translation but the interpretation.
</p>
<p>
 Count the items: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11. Then the next line says “twelve”. Surely not a coincidence? In Pali
 <em>
  dvādasa
 </em>
 serves for both “twelve” and “twelfth”, so we can translate:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  One the root, two the loops,
  <br/>
  three the stains, five the spreads,
  <br/>
  and the ocean, the twelfth whirlpool:
  <br/>
  such is the abyss crossed over by the seer.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Now, if the items are meant to add up to twelve, the significance of the term
 <em>
  āvaṭṭa
 </em>
 (cycle, round, whirlpool) comes to the fore. Dependent origination has twelve items, and it describes the round (
 <em>
  vaṭṭa
 </em>
 ) of transmigration.
</p>
<p>
 Most of the items lend themselves to such an interpretation:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  The “one root” is ignorance;
 </li>
 <li>
  the “two loops” are name-and-form with consciousness (
  <a>
   dn15:22.6
  </a>
  );
 </li>
 <li>
  the “three stains” are ignorance, craving, and grasping;
 </li>
 <li>
  the “five spreads” are perhaps the five consequents starting with consciousness;
  <ul>
   <li>
    This is not very persuasive, admittedly. Perhaps there is a better?
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  and the “ocean” is transmigration itself.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 It seems to me this is a more satisfying reading, as it fits all the teachings in a coherent whole, without having to assign meaning arbitrarily.
