  <h1>Apāyamukha in the EBTs doesn’t mean “path to a lower realm”</h1>

 In popular Theravada, one encounters the term
 <em>
  apāyamukha
 </em>
 reasonably frequently as a blanket term for kinds of conduct that lead to lower rebirths. In this reading,
 <em>
  apāya
 </em>
 means “lower realm” and
 <em>
  mukha
 </em>
 means “cause”.
</p>
<p>
 The term is occasionally encountered in the EBTs, but it seems that it never has this sense. Rather, in AN 4.178, AN 8.54, and AN 8.55 it is used in the sense of “drain”, that is, an “opening” (
 <em>
  mukha
 </em>
 ) for “leaking out”
 <em>
  apāya
 </em>
 . The basic application of it is to the things that are a “drain” on wealth, such as gambling, etc. In this sense it also occurs in DN 31. In AN 4.178 and DN 3 the metaphor is applied somewhat differently, but the basic idea is the same. In none of these contexts does
 <em>
  apāya
 </em>
 mean “lower realm”, nor does the phrase have anything to do with the causes of rebirth.
</p>
<p>
 It seems that the popular sense must have emerged later on. Anyway, it’s useful to know such things when reading the suttas. Someone should really compile a list of terms that have different meanings in the suttas and later.

 I’m sure it would not be controversial at all!
