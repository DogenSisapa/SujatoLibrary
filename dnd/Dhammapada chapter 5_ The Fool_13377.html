<p>
 Long is the night for the wakeful;
 <br/>
 long is the league for the weary.
 <br/>
 Long transmigrate the fools
 <br/>
 who don’t understand the true teaching.
</p>
<p>
 If while wandering you find no partner
 <br/>
 equal or better than yourself,
 <br/>
 then firmly resolve to wander alone—
 <br/>
 there’s no fellowship with fools.
</p>
<p>
 The fool worries, thinking:
 <br/>
 “Sons are mine, wealth is mine.”
 <br/>
 But you can’t even call your self your own,
 <br/>
 let alone your sons or wealth.
</p>
<p>
 The fool who thinks they’re a fool
 <br/>
 is wise to at least that extent.
 <br/>
 But the true fool is said to be the one
 <br/>
 who imagines that they are wise.
</p>
<p>
 If someone who’s foolish attends to the wise
 <br/>
 even for the rest of their life,
 <br/>
 still they don’t experience the teaching,
 <br/>
 like a spoon the taste of the soup.
</p>
<p>
 If someone intelligent attends to the wise
 <br/>
 even just for an hour or so,
 <br/>
 swiftly they experience the teaching,
 <br/>
 like a tongue the taste of the soup.
</p>
<p>
 Fools and idiots behave
 <br/>
 like their own worst enemies,
 <br/>
 doing wicked deeds
 <br/>
 that ripen as bitter fruit.
</p>
<p>
 It’s not good to do the kind of deed
 <br/>
 that makes you feel guilty,
 <br/>
 for which you weep and wail,
 <br/>
 as its effect stays with you.
</p>
<p>
 It is good to do the kind of deed
 <br/>
 that doesn’t make you feel guilty,
 <br/>
 for which you’re happy and joyful,
 <br/>
 as its effect stays with you.
</p>
<p>
 The fool imagines that evil is sweet,
 <br/>
 so long as it has not yet ripened.
 <br/>
 But when that evil ripens in fruit,
 <br/>
 they plummet down into pain.
</p>
<p>
 Month after month a fool may eat
 <br/>
 food with a blade of grass,
 <br/>
 but they’ll never be worth a sixteenth part
 <br/>
 of one who has realized the teaching.
</p>
<p>
 For a wicked deed that has been done
 <br/>
 does not spoil quickly like milk.
 <br/>
 Smoldering, it follows the fool,
 <br/>
 like a fire smothered over with ash.
</p>
<p>
 Whatever a fool has managed to learn,
 <br/>
 it only gives rise to harm.
 <br/>
 It ruins their good points,
 <br/>
 blowing their head into bits.
</p>
<p>
 They’d seek the esteem that they lack,
 <br/>
 and status among the mendicants;
 <br/>
 authority over monasteries,
 <br/>
 and honor among other families.
</p>
<p>
 “Let both layfolk and renunciants think
 <br/>
 that it was done by me alone.
 <br/>
 In anything at all that’s to be done,
 <br/>
 let them fall under my sway alone.”
 <br/>
 So thinks the fool,
 <br/>
 their greed and pride only growing.
</p>
<p>
 For the path to profit and the path to quenching
 <br/>
 are two quite different things.
 <br/>
 A mendicant disciple of the Buddha,
 <br/>
 understanding what this really means,
 <br/>
 would never delight in honors,
 <br/>
 but rather would foster seclusion.
