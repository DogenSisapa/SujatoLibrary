 Venerable, I’m just going through these passages once more, trying to wrap my head around it!
</p>
<p>
 I like your approach and I want to see in what way it should be applied.

<p>
 So far we have considered the cases of
 <em>
  hoti tathāgato paraṁ maraṇā
 </em>
 . Previous discussions have touched on
 <em>
  atthi attā

   wrote an essay

  on the meaning of n’atthi atta in SN44.10–the sutta on Vacchagotta’s questions on the existence of a self. That topic is old and has sparked many discussions already. I have a point related to it, but which is also wider, so I thought I’d open a new topic to make that point. 
Sujato argues the verb atthi often describes what he calls “absolute existence”. This may be true, but atthi is far from always used in this sense, so maybe there is som…

  It is generally understood that in the Indic idiom, words meaning “to be” can slide into a more pregnant philosophical sense, especially with the implication of “eternal, changeless existence”. If something really is, or so it’s felt, it exists in a timeless, essential sense. This is perhaps akin to Plato’s forms. Obviously the Buddha’s philosophy opposed this tendency. Such notions are usually made explicit in the EBTs, so it is not easy to find clear examples of cases where the mere use of the…

<p>
 In the latter cases I have used “exist absolutely”. This is not very idiomatic English, and according to your argument, also misses the nuance of the verb “to be” here, which is about
 <em>
  time
 </em>
 not
 <em>
  being
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The thing that’s persuasive to me is that in all of these cases, the issue at hand is, indeed, to do with time, and specifically survival after death.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Pasenadi explains
  <em>
   atthi devā
  </em>
  as whether gods come back to this world
 </li>
 <li>
  The Buddha says
  <em>
   natthi attā
  </em>
  would side with annihilationists, i.e. “the self (which currently exists) will cease to do so.”
 </li>
 <li>
  And the state of the Tathagata is obviously about what happens “after death”.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 There are a couple of interesting nuances to this:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  it doesn’t seem t matter whether the verb is
  <em>
   hoti
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   atthi
  </em>
 </li>
 <li>
  each of the statements either explicitly refer to rebirth or are explained as such.
 </li>
 <li>
  they don’t make great sense if translated in “boring present”.
 </li>
 <li>
  they’re not in contexts of ontological metaphysics that would justify “exist absolutely”
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Now, as to translation. As always, it would be nice to be consistent, so long as that does not sacrifice sense.
</p>
<p>
 In the case of “do gods exist”, using “still” would be problematic, as it would imply that they may have gone extinct: “do gods still exist?”
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps we could use “survive” here?
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  “Do gods survive?”
 </li>
 <li>
  “Does the self survive?”
 </li>
 <li>
  “Does a Realized One survive after death?”
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 What do you think?
</p>
<p>
 Another option might be:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  “Do gods go on?”
 </li>
 <li>
  “Does the self go on?”
 </li>
 <li>
  “Does a Realized One go on after death?”
 </li>
</ul>

 Perhaps we could use “affirmed” to make this distinction clearer?
