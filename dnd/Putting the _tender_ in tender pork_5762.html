  <h1>Putting the “tender” in tender pork</h1>

  <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/putting-the-tender-in-tender-pork/5762">https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/putting-the-tender-in-tender-pork/5762</a></p>
  <p>
 One of the best known controversies in Buddhism is over the Buddha’s last meal, and specifically whether
 <em>
  sūkaramaddava
 </em>
 refers to pork.
 <em>
  Sūkara
 </em>
 means “pig” and
 <em>
  maddava
 </em>
 means “ tender”, so the most obvious reading is “tender pork”.
</p>
<p>
 However, the commentary, as well as various Chinese translations, include several different interpretations, showing that this is by no means just a modern question.
</p>
<p>
 As a vegetarian all my adult life, I find the idea of eating pig quite revolting; but perhaps it is even more revolting than I thought.
</p>
<p>
 One of the arguments that has been raised against “pork” and in favor of something like, say, mushroom that are eaten by pigs, is why the Buddha should fall sick after eating. Pork, despite the dirty reputations of pigs, is not an especially dangerous meat.
</p>
<p>
 While discussion has been centered on the implication of
 <em>
  sūkara
 </em>
 , so far as I know no-one has pointed out that
 <em>
  maddava
 </em>
 occurs in a more precise sense at Dhp#377:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Vassikā viya pupphāni,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   maddavāni  pamuñcati;
  </em>
  <br/>
  Just as the jasmine creeper
  <br/>
  sheds its
  <strong>
   withered
  </strong>
  flowers
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here it refers to flowers that have become overripe, softening and withering on the vine, until they fall off.
</p>
<p>
 Now, it used to be quite a common practice that game meat would be left a little while to “turn” or become “high” before cooking, in order to tenderize it. This would naturally increase the amount of dangerous bacteria, as borne out by modern studies, in which wild pigs were used. (My apologies for the source, but it is quite a good article!)

   Anthropologists at Harvard University in Massachusetts found roasting meat on hot coals as early humans were suspected to have done can kill off most dangerous bacteria.

 The authors argue that cooking evolved as a means of reducing bacteria in meat on the turn.

 The distinction between wild and domesticated pigs in those days would not have been that great, and the flesh would probably have been much tougher than modern pork. So  Cunda may have left the meat for a while to soften before cooking, and this could have been the source of the Buddha’s illness. Thus we should translate “pork on the turn”.
