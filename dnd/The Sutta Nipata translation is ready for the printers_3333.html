 We just heard from our partners at
 <a href="http://Budaedu.org">
  Budaedu.org
 </a>
 that the printed edition of the Sutta Nipata is ready to go. This is the new translation by Lawrence Khantipalo Mills, which I have discussed in
 <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/complete-sutta-nipata-translation-available-in-english/1646">

 This is an unusual edition for us, as it contains not just the translation but extensive commentary and notes by Lawrence. While the translation itself is available on the site, the commentary is not (except in the pdf).

 Weâ€™re proud to offer this text, the final work by one of the most important figures in the early development of monastic Theravada in the west generally, and Australia in particular.

 is keeping a list of volunteers to help with distribution. This is of great assistance to our publisher, as it helps keep their postage costs down. The books are sent out in boxes of 34, so if you can take a box or a few boxes around to centers or wherever in your city, that would be great.
