  <p>
 The word
 <em>
  saṅkhāra
 </em>
 is an important doctrinal term in Buddhism. It has a wide variety of meanings, which is usually an indication of a long history. Here is a quick indicative survey of uses before the Buddha, in the primary pre-Buddhist texts, presented in rough chronological order. I’ll do a bit of a summary at the end.

  </em>
  <br/>

<p>
 (i.e. the ritual performed corresponds with the year with its seasons.)
</p>

 SB 3.5.4.24
</p>

  <em>

  <br/>
  they prepare him another self,–to wit, this sacrifice, consisting of Ṛc and Yajus and Sāman and oblations,–that becomes his self in yonder world
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The action of the ritual creates a new or transformed self in the next life.

<p>
 SB 6.2.1.5 (also 9)
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   ime vā agnirimānevātmānamabhisaṃskaravai

<p>
 Seems to be about transforming or perfecting one’s self by analogy with the ritual?
</p>
<p>
 SB 6.2.1.27 (and 33)
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>

 SB 6.7.2.6
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   garutmānvīryamevainametadabhisaṃskaroti
  </em>
  <br/>
  he therefore creates him so as to be endowed with vigor
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I.e. performs the ritual in the proper way, thus endowing the ritual with the qualities of the Garuda who is energy (
 <em>
  vīrya
 </em>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 SB 6.8.1.4
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   mānuṣaṃ rūpaṃ tadasyatena saṃskaroti
  </em>
  <br/>
  he creates the human form (or divine form)
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 SB 6.8.2.1
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   sadātmānamabhisaṃskariṣyāmahe maryāḥ kuṇapā
  </em>
  <br/>
  If we create this, such as it is, part of our own self, we shall become mortal carcasses, not freed from sin
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 SB 7.1.2.11 (a common idiom)
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   sarvaṃ kṛtsnaṃ saṃskaty
  </em>
  <br/>
  he restores him so as to be whole and entire
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 SB 7.1.2.21
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   sarvāṃ vācaṃ sarvam prāṇaṃ sarvamātmānaṃ saṃskurute
  </em>
  <br/>
  makes up for himself the whole Vāc (speech), the whole vital air, the whole body (of Prajāpati)
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 SB 7.2.1.1
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   imameva taṃ lokaṃ saṃskṛtya samārohaṃste
  </em>
  <br/>
  it is this world they (the gods) ascended after completing it (the sacrificial fire)
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 SB 7.5.2.32 (also 33, 34, 35, 36)
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   tanūstena cinvāna ātmānaṃ saṃskuruṣvetyetanmayuṃ
  </em>
  <br/>
  the form is the self: thus, 'Building up therewith, perfect thyself
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Obscure to me, but related to the idea of the substitute sacrifice. The sacrificer begs Agni to accept the
 <em>
  kimpuruṣa
 </em>
 (“what man?”). The translator says it is unclear, perhaps a fashioned facsimile or else a monkey.

<p>
 The overriding sense is to “make” or “create” or “fashion” something, especially in a good way, to “perfect” (which is in fact a close verbal parallel, “full-make”).
</p>
<p>
 The oldest uses in the Rig Veda tend to emphasize the making or construction of some physical item, a use echoed in, say, Dhp 154, or the sense of “readied, prepared”.
</p>
<p>
 Over time the sense of “prepared” (for the sacrifice) came to dominate. But this is really just a reflection of the kind of literature, which concerns the ritual, while presumably in secular usage it continued to have the sense we see in the Rig Veda. This usage is extremely common in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, these are just a selection of quotes.
</p>
<p>
 This then leads to a more pregnant philosophical sense, where the action of the sacrifice builds or creates or transforms the self, by analogy or identity, so that the created self goes to heaven. This is evident in such Pali contexts as MN 120, although obviously the sacrifice has been replaced by ethical action.
</p>
<p>
 The sense of “all conditioned things" is not found at all, and should be understood as a specifically Buddhist dialectic: “The world of creation embodied in your ritual (which you have worked so hard to get just right under the assumption that it is the eternal emanation of divinity) is really just the product of many different choices and actions, all of which are impermanent and corrupted, and which create a phenomenal world that’s just as bad”.
</p>
<p>
 The positive connotation of
 <em>
  saṅkhāra
 </em>
 in the sense of “well-made, properly prepared” is an assumed ironic substrata of this:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Alas, perfections are impermanent!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I.e., “What you think is so well made is falling apart”.
</p>
<p>
 In Buddhism the idea of a creative action being the ritual was completely replaced by ethical action, i.e. making good moral choices. This sense, as so often, rapidly dominated, so that later generations of Buddhists forgot the context in which the Buddha was speaking.
