  <p>
 Here’s a short passage from DN 25 Udumbarikasīhanada. It’s one of my favorites. It’s a very moving summary of why we teach and practice Dhamma, and the right way to do interreligious dialogue.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Nigrodha, you might think: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants pupils.’
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  But you should not see it like this. Let your teacher remain your teacher.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  You might think: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to give up our recitation.’
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  But you should not see it like this. Let your recitation remain as it is.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  You might think: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to give up our livelihood.’
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  But you should not see it like this. Let your livelihood remain as it is.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  You might think: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to start doing things that are unskillful and considered unskillful in our tradition.’
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  But you should not see it like this. Let those things that are unskillful and considered unskillful in your tradition remain as they are.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  But you should not see it like this. Let those things that are skillful and considered skillful in your tradition remain as they are.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  I do not speak for any of these reasons.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Nigrodha, there are things that are unskillful, corrupted, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future birth, old age, and death. I teach Dhamma so that those things may be given up.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.
