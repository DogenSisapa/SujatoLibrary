 DN 26 presents a Buddhist apocalypse, the utter demise of society. Beings end up with swords in their hands, with no thought in mind but killing. After hiding for a period, they emerge and see each other for the first time. They embrace and shout words of celebration.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   ‘diṭṭhā, bho, sattā jīvasi, diṭṭhā, bho, sattā jīvasī’ti.
  </em>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The words seem fairly standard.
 <em>
  Diṭṭha
 </em>
 is a common word for “seen”, and
 <em>
  satta
 </em>
 is “being”. A literal translation would then be:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  “(You are) seen, good being, you live! (You are) seen, good being, you live!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It’s a bit unusual to refer to another person as “being”, but well, unusual things happen.
</p>
<p>
 Rhys Davids translated it:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  “Hail, O mortal, that thou livest still! O happy sight to find thee still alive!”
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Maurice Walshe has:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  “Good beings, I see that you are alive!”
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 But none of this is grammatical. The vocative address is
 <em>
  bho
 </em>
 (singular, “sir”, “my good man!”), agreeing with the singular verb (
 <em>
  jīvasi
 </em>
 ). However,
 <em>
  diṭṭhā
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  sattā
 </em>
 under this reading must be plural. This puzzled me for a long time and I just chalked it up to a faulty transmission.
</p>
<p>
 In fact, neither of these words are what they seem.
</p>
<p>
 In my previous translation, I realized that
 <em>
  diṭṭhā
 </em>
 is Sanskrit
 <em>
  diṣṭyā
 </em>
 , an expression of glee and rejoicing: “fantastic, how fortunate”, per dn16:2.24.5 and ja81:1.4.
</p>
<p>
 I only just now realized that
 <em>
  sattā
 </em>
 must be nominative singular for
 <em>
  sattar
 </em>
 (“enemy”), not plural of
 <em>
  satta
 </em>
 (“being”) which disagrees with both verb and vocative in number.
</p>
<p>
 Thus for what I believe is the very first time, let me unveil an accurate translation of this sentence:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  ‘Fantastic, dear foe, you live! Fantastic, dear foe, you live!’
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Much more dramatic!
</p>
<p>
 The punctuation in the Mahasangiti edition is also incorrect. Since
 <em>
  jīvasi
 </em>
 is second person,
 <em>
  sattā
 </em>
 must be a vocative.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   ‘diṭṭhā, bho sattā, jīvasi, diṭṭhā, bho sattā, jīvasī’ti.
  </em>
