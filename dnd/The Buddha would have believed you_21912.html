 I was kindly invited by Buddhadharma magazine to make a contribution to their recent edition, on the topic of community. I wrote about the threat of sexual abuse in patriarchal communities, and how the Buddha laid down a rule that monks should believe women.

 I’m happy that Buddhadharma had the guts to print it, as I’m guessing a lot of people won’t like it.

   In too many Buddhist communities, women have not been believed when revealing harm caused by men. Bhikkhu Sujato looks to the Vinaya and finds another approach.
