 In DN 5 Kūṭadanta, the Buddha tells a story of a wise counselor of the past who advised his king on social policy.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   ‘bhoto kho rañño janapado sakaṇṭako sauppīḷo, gāmaghātāpi dissanti, nigamaghātāpi dissanti, nagaraghātāpi dissanti, panthaduhanāpi dissanti.
  </em>
  <br/>
  ‘Sir, the king’s realm is harried and oppressed. Bandits have been seen raiding villages, town, and cities, and infesting the highways.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Bhavaṃ kho pana rājā evaṃ sakaṇṭake janapade sauppīḷe balimuddhareyya, akiccakārī assa tena bhavaṃ rājā.
  </em>
  <br/>
  But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed, he would not be doing his duty.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Siyā kho pana bhoto rañño evamassa:
  </em>
  <br/>
  Now the king might think:
  <br/>
  <em>
   “ahametaṃ dassukhīlaṃ vadhena vā bandhena vā jāniyā vā garahāya vā pabbājanāya vā samūhanissāmī”ti, na kho panetassa dassukhīlassa evaṃ sammā samugghāto hoti.
  </em>
  <br/>
  “I’ll uproot this barbarian obstacle by execution or imprisonment or condemnation or banishment!” But that’s not the right way to uproot this barbarian obstacle.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Ye te hatāvasesakā bhavissanti, te pacchā rañño janapadaṃ viheṭhessanti.
  </em>
  <br/>
  Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the king’s realm.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Api ca kho idaṃ saṃvidhānaṃ āgamma evametassa dassukhīlassa sammā samugghāto hoti.
  </em>
  <br/>
  Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the barbarian obstacle will be properly uprooted.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Tena hi bhavaṃ rājā ye bhoto rañño janapade ussahanti kasigorakkhe, tesaṃ bhavaṃ rājā bījabhattaṃ anuppadetu.
  </em>
  <br/>
  So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in farming and raising cattle.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Ye bhoto rañño janapade ussahanti vāṇijjāya, tesaṃ bhavaṃ rājā pābhataṃ anuppadetu.
  </em>
  <br/>
  Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Ye bhoto rañño janapade ussahanti rājaporise, tesaṃ bhavaṃ rājā bhattavetanaṃ pakappetu.
  </em>
  <br/>
  Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Te ca manussā sakammapasutā rañño janapadaṃ na viheṭhessanti;
  </em>
  <br/>
  Then the people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm.
  <br/>
  <em>
   mahā ca rañño rāsiko bhavissati.
  </em>
  <br/>
  The king’s revenues will be great.
  <br/>
  <em>
   Khemaṭṭhitā janapadā akaṇṭakā anuppīḷā manussā mudā modamānā ure putte naccentā apārutagharā maññe viharissantī’ti.
  </em>
  <br/>
  When the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell as if their houses were wide open.’
