 In MN 37, Sakka shows Moggallāna around his lovely Palace of Victory, apparently trying to distract him from the fact that Sakka forgot the Buddha’s teaching.
</p>
<p>
 When they see him coming the celestial maidens (
 <em>
  paricārikā
 </em>
 ) each go to their own rooms. The translations are unanimous in describing their flustered state.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Chalmers: Sakka’s handmaidens fled in fear and shame
 </li>
 <li>
  Horner: shrinking and shy
 </li>
 <li>
  Uppalavanna: with remorse and shame
 </li>
 <li>
  Ñāṇamoḷi: conscience-stricken and ashamed
 </li>
 <li>
  Bodhi: embarrassed and ashamed
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Not to put too fine a point on it, but these translations are all sexist as hell. The only person in the dialogue who has reason to be ashamed is Sakka, who not only forgot the teaching, but who deliberately tried to avoid being reminded of the fact. Yet somehow the girls, having done precisely nothing wrong, are the shamed ones, not the patriarch. Sound familiar?

 The Pali is
 <em>
  ottappamānā hirīyamānā
 </em>
 .
 <em>
  Ottappa
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  hiri
 </em>
 are some of the best known and most universally praised virtues in Buddhism. I usually translate them as “prudence” and “conscience”. They are said to be the bright things that protect the world (
 <em>
  lokapāla
 </em>
 ) (AN 2.9). They appear in countless discourses as fundamental virtues that underlie ethical behavior and the spiritual path in general, and their absence is a sure sign of spiritual and moral decline.
</p>
<p>
 The maidens are said to possess these cardinal virtues, yet the translations implicitly slut-shame them, making it appear as if they have something to hide. Here is the correct translation:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  When they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maidens, being prudent and discreet, each went to her own room.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Here we could use “conscientious” for
 <em>
  hiri
 </em>
 , but “discreet” works better, I think.
