  <blockquote>
 <p>
  We have relentlessly scoured the sacred from the world, filling the earth’s veins with acid, scoffing contemptuously at those who worship the sky and the rivers. We point and laugh at how useless their endless rites were, how cruel their sacrifices; and how, even when they served their gods properly with ritual and oblation, they were still struck with drought or failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet it is a singular fact that none of them, not a single one of the supposedly benighted superstitions of the past, bequeathed us a planet decimated with ruin. When it comes to apocalypse, religions like to talk big. We speak of the end of the world, our words laden with prophecy and portent. Yet our dooms are, in the end, domestic affairs, more local tragedy than global annihilation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be that the ancient traditions of the world did, in fact, hold a precious wisdom, one through which humanity was able to find its balance in nature? Could it be that the arrogant, reductive elimination of myth and meaning, of the divinity in the stars, is leading to the exact result foretold in the ancient wisdom?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hereafter, when kings shall be stingy and unrighteous, and when folk shall be unrighteous, in days when the world is perverted, when good is waning and evil waxing apace—in those days of the world’s discontent there shall fall no rain from the heavens, the feet of the storm shall be lamed, the crops shall wither, and famine shall be on the land. Then shall the clouds gather as if for rain from the four quarters of the heavens, but they shall flee away without raining. (Jātaka 77)
