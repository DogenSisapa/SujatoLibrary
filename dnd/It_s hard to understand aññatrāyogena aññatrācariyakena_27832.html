  <p>
 Five times (dn9:24.3, dn24:2.21.11, dn25:7.15, mn72:18.3, mn80:14.6) we have a passage where the Buddha, in conversation with someone from another sect, warns them that it is hard for them to understand the Dhamma. This is usually understood by the commentaries, dictionaries, and translations as such:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dujjānaṁ kho etaṁ, poṭṭhapāda, tayā aññadiṭṭhikena aññakhantikena aññarucikena aññatrāyogena aññatrācariyakena
  </em>
  <br/>
  It’s hard for you to understand this, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Bhikkhu Bodhi has a similar rendering:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  hold another view, accept another teaching, approve of another teaching, pursue a different training, and follow a different teacher.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 There are a few variant readings, but none that affect the sense (
 <em>
  aññatra
 </em>
 →
 <em>
  aññattha
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  āyoga
 </em>
 →
 <em>
  yoga
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  pāyoga
 </em>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 The problem is that the list switches the initial word of the compound from
 <em>
  añña
 </em>
 (“other, different”) to
 <em>
  aññatra
 </em>
 (“apart from, except”). Yet so far as I know everyone (including myself) treats the change in wording as meaningless, as if this is merely an unusual sense of
 <em>
  aññatra
 </em>
 . What if we’re all wrong?
</p>
<p>
 The first three terms are all synonyms:
 <em>
  diṭṭhi
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  khanti
 </em>
 , and
 <em>
  ruci
 </em>
 . These are all commonly used in the sense that they appear here, as one’s “beliefs” or “opinions”. The Buddha is saying that it is hard to understand the Dhamma so long as one adheres to such beliefs.
</p>
<p>
 But does this not strike you as somewhat incomplete, and unusually negative for the Buddha? Surely it is more in character for him to say, “Well it is hard to understand with those beliefs,
 <em>
  unless
 </em>
 you do the work?”
</p>
<p>
 The last two terms in the list have a somewhat different meaning:
 <em>
  āyoga
 </em>
 means “effort, striving, application to meditation practice”, while
 <em>
  <em>
   ācariyaka
  </em>
 </em>
 means “that which comes from a teacher, i.e. a tradition, teacher’s lineage or community”.  This is implicitly acknowledged in the commentary, which treat these terms differently, essentially explaining
 <em>
  aññatra
 </em>
 as
 <em>
  añña
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If we were to retain the normal sense of
 <em>
  aññatra
 </em>
 we might translate:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  It’s hard for you to understand this, since you have a different view, creed, preference, without dedication to practice and the guidance of a tradition.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Now the Buddha’s message is more constructive. He’s not telling them they can’t do it, just letting them know what it will take.
</p>
<p>
 I’d feel better about adopting this reading if I found even a single source who agreed with me!
