 <em>
  Paravediya
 </em>
 , to be resolved “other-knowable”,  occurs three times in the EBTs, so far as I know. All the passages are in verse; here they are, with the best available translations.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   DN 19
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Pucchāmi brahmānaṃ sanaṅkumāraṃ,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Kaṅkhī akaṅkhiṃ paravediyesu;
  </em>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Rhy Davids
  </strong>
  <br/>
  I ask the Brahma, the Eternal Youth,
  <br/>
  Him past all doubt I, doubting, ask about
  <br/>
  The things that others would fain know about.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ud 5.7
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Yā kāci kaṅkhā idha vā huraṃ vā,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Sakavediyā vā paravediyā vā
  </em>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Anandajoti
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Whatever doubts there are about here or hereafter,
  <br/>
  Understandable by oneself, or understandable by another
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Snp 3.4#479
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Āsaṃ anissāya vivekadassī,
  </em>
  <br/>
  <em>
   Paravediyaṃ diṭṭhi­mu­pātivatto
  </em>
  <br/>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  <br/>
  Not dependent on desire, seeing separation,
  <br/>
  gone beyond the view which can be known by others.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 As you can see, all agree that it means “what can be known by others” (i.e.
 <em>
  parena vediya
 </em>
 ). But I fail to see what this actually means. The contexts are fairly consistent, about overcoming doubts and clarifying views, but what do we care about what others can know?
</p>
<p>
 Elsewhere, the term
 <em>
  para
 </em>
 is used in a similar context, with a much better defined meaning. There are said to be two conditions for the arising of right view: the words of another (
 <em>
  parato ghoso
 </em>
 ), and rational reflection (
 <em>
  yoniso manisikāra
 </em>
 ). These refer to the two aspects of growing wisdom: there are some things we can learn from external sources, but they only ripen into wisdom when we apply them to our own situation. The duality of self/other, while implicit in the very mention of
 <em>
  para
 </em>
 , is made explicit in the Udāna passage.
</p>
<p>
 I propose that we revise our understanding of these passages in this light, and read the phrase as “knowable from another” (
 <em>
  parato vediya
 </em>
 ). Thus:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   DN 19
  </strong>
  <br/>
  I am in doubt, so I ask Brahmā—who is free of doubt—
  <br/>
  about things one may learn from another.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ud 5.7
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Whatever doubts there are about here or hereafter,
  <br/>
  that one may learn about by oneself or from another
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Snp 3.4#479
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Not relying on hope, seeing seclusion,
  <br/>
  gone beyond views that may be learned from others
 </p>
