<p>
 Heedfulness is the state of the deathless;
 <br/>
 heedlessness, the state of death.
 <br/>
 The heedful do not die,
 <br/>
 while the heedless are as if already dead.
</p>
<p>
 Understanding this distinction
 <br/>
 concerning heedfulness,
 <br/>
 the astute rejoice in heedfulness,
 <br/>
 happy in the noble ones’ domain.
</p>
<p>
 They who persistently meditate,
 <br/>
 always staunchly vigorous—
 <br/>
 those wise ones realize extinguishment,
 <br/>
 the supreme sanctuary.
</p>
<p>
 For those who are hard-working and mindful,
 <br/>
 pure of deed and heedful,
 <br/>
 restrained, living properly, and diligent:
 <br/>
 their reputation only grows.
</p>
<p>
 By hard work and diligence,
 <br/>
 by restraint and by taming,
 <br/>
 a smart person would build an island
 <br/>
 that the floods cannot overflow.
</p>
<p>
 Fools and unintelligent people
 <br/>
 devote themselves to negligence.
 <br/>
 But the intelligent protect diligence
 <br/>
 as their best treasure.
</p>
<p>
 Don’t devote yourself to negligence,
 <br/>
 or delight in sexual intimacy.
 <br/>
 For if you’re diligent and meditate,
 <br/>
 you’ll attain abundant happiness.
</p>
<p>
 When the astute dispel negligence
 <br/>
 by means of diligence,
 <br/>
 ascending the palace of wisdom,
 <br/>
 sorrowless, they behold this generation of sorrow,
 <br/>
 as a wise man on a mountain-top
 <br/>
 beholds the fools below.
</p>
<p>
 Diligent among the negligent,
 <br/>
 wide awake while others sleep—
 <br/>
 a true sage leaves them behind,
 <br/>
 like a swift horse passing a feeble.
</p>
<p>
 Maghavā became chief of the gods
 <br/>
 by means of diligence.
 <br/>
 They praise diligence,
 <br/>
 while negligence is always deplored.
</p>
<p>
 A mendicant who loves to be diligent,
 <br/>
 seeing fear in negligence—
 <br/>
 advances like fire,
 <br/>
 burning up fetters big and small.
</p>
<p>
 A mendicant who loves to be diligent,
 <br/>
 seeing fear in negligence—
 <br/>
 such a one cannot decline,
 <br/>
 and has drawn near to extinguishment.
