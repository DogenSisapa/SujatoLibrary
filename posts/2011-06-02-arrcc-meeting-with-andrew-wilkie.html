    <p>Meeting number two: Andrew Wilkie, one of the independent MPs who hold th balance of power in our minoity government.</p>
<p>Wilkie started by mentioning he’d been in a meeting to try to stop live animal exports – a moral blight, which the animal rights movement has been agitating against since I was in Animal Liberation in the mid 80s.</p>
<p>Present were Bishop George Browning, Sister Geraldine Kearny (Catholic Religious Australia), Father Charles Rue (Columban), and Rev Rex Graham (Uniting Earthweb).</p>
<p>Wilkie was supportive of carbon tax, noting that he came primarily from a social justice perspectice, and sees climate change in these terms: bringing justice to the poor. He agreed that we need leadership to show the way. We spoke of creating a vision of a future that we want to live in.</p>
<p>He strongly agreed that the crucial thing was getting the mechanism in place, and seemed to be onfident that the pieces were falling together to make this a reality. In discussions with the PM, their concern was for how to implement the best policy, underlying a basic agreement on the seriousness of the problem and the need for committed action.</p>
<p>Wilkie asked us to keep the channels open, and congratulated us in our efforts, and encouraged us to keep going.</p>
