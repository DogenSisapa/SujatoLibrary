    <p>For those of you looking for ways to help the people of Haiti after the recent earthquake disaster, may I recommend the wonderful work of the Taiwan-based <a href="http://www.us.tzuchi.org/usa/home.nsf/home/index?OpenDocument">Tzu Chi</a>. They’re always there, efficient and ready with practical help on the ground. I can’t praise their work highly enough. </p>
<p>The scale of the suffering in Haiti right now is incomprehensible, and it’s so important that we don’t just give up in the face of the scale of these disasters. As human populations grow, our climate becomes more unstable, resources more scarce, and our social structure more unequal, these crises will only grow in frequency and magnitude. Wherever people are in the world, we should help them as if they were our naighbours or our family – because they are.</p>
