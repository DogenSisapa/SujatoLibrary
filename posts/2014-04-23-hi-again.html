    <p>Long time no see. My apologies to all readers if they feel like they have been stranded. Or really, not “feel like”, actually been stranded. </p>
<p>There is no very good reason for my absence, except that I have been focussing on other things. Specifically, I have been finishing a major project for SuttaCentral: a digital edition of I.B. Horner’s translation of the Pali Vinaya. As work on that continued, I really, really, wanted to get it done, and done well, and for that I have let other aspects of my digital life slip (unread emails: 325 and counting…)</p>
<p>Anyway, that is done now. Yesterday I finally got it together and sent it around to our team. So I am turning attention to a variety of other things that I have put on the backburner, including this blog. I will be playing around with new themes, in both form and content. </p>
<p>There is, of course, more to it than that. Part of the issue has been that I have been struggling with expression: I am not sure how to say what I think is most meaningful to say. I haven’t solved this, but I am willing to start trying.</p>
<p>For all those who have left comments, thanks, I will try to get around to answering them in the next little while, your patience is appreciated!</p>
