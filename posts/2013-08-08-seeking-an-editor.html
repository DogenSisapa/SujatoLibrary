    <p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>For the past few years I’ve been involved with the group <a href="http://www.buddhismandpsychotherapy.org/" target="_blank">AABCAP</a>, who have run a wonderful course on Buddhism and Psychotherapy. We’ve planned to make a book based on the course, and have interest from a publisher. However, we need an editor. We don’t have any funds available, so I’m afraid it is strictly a volunteer job. If there’s anyone with the skills and time, and of course interest, to help out with this, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
