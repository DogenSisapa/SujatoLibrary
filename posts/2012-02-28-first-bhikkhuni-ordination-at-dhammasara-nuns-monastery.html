    <p>Some wonderful news: there’s going to be a bhikkhuni ordination in Perth this Thursday! Myself and Ayya Sudhamma will be going from Santi to participate. This will be the first bhikkhuni ordination at Dhammasara – the previous bhikkhuni ordination was held at Bodhinyana.</p>
<p>It’s all been organized very swiftly, so all we have is the brief announcement from Dhammasara.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dhammasara Nuns’ Monastery is delighted to announce that the “First Bhikkhuni Ordination” will take place at Dhammasara on Thursday, 1st March 2012 in the morning at 8am, before dana.</p>
<p>Candidates : Samaneri Pasada from Santi Forest Monastery, NSW and Samaneri Nissara from Nirodharam Meditation Centre, Thailand.</p>
<p>Both presently staying at Dhammasara Nuns’ Monastery.</p>
<p>This is coming about at short notice due to a brief visit of our Pavatini (Preceptor), Venerable Tathaaloka Bhikkhuni Theri, from USA.</p>
<p>Followed by the dana at Dhammasara.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, the two one sided Bhikkhunis will present themselves to Bhikkhu Sangha at Bodhinyana Monks Monastery, Serpentine for a brief Sangha Kamma (Ceremony) to confirm the ordination (the afternoon time yet to be determined).</p>
<p>Both events are open to our supporters and friends.</p>
<p>With Metta,</p>
<p>Ven. Nirodha &amp; Ven. Hasapanna</p></blockquote>
