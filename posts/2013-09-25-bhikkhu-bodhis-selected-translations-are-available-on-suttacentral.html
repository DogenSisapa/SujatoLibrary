    <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://sujato.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/bhikkhu-bodhis-selected-translations-are-available-on-suttacentral/">https://sujato.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/bhikkhu-bodhis-selected-translations-are-available-on-suttacentral/</a></p>
    <p>So, the time has come. Or at least, <em>a</em> time. </p>
<p>We have just uploaded a wide range of English sutta translations by Bhikkhu Bodhi to SuttaCentral. Not all of them, yet, but all that we are legally permitted to use. They include a substantial selection from each of the three Nikayas that he has translated: the Middle length Discourses, the Connected Discourses, and the Numerical Discourses.</p>
<p>You can read about <a href="http://suttacentral.net/sn1.1/en/" target="_blank">crossing the flood</a>, or the <a href="http://suttacentral.net/an3.13/en/" target="_blank">kinds of persons who have expectations</a>, or <a href="http://suttacentral.net/mn4/en/" target="_blank">how the Buddha got scared in his meditation</a>!</p>
<p>The whole range of translations can be accessed through the relevant nikaya pages <a href="http://suttacentral.net/mn" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://suttacentral.net/sn" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://suttacentral.net/an" target="_blank">here</a>, with BB’s translations the first listed in the right hand column.</p>
<p>We give great thanks to Bhikkhu Bodhi, for having created these extraordinary translations, which are the gold standard for accuracy and readability. He has been quietly championing SuttaCentral for some time, and has a great wish to see the Suttas become more widely available. We also thank Wisdom Publications, for working on these texts with Ven Bodhi for so many years, and for kindly releasing these selections under a Creative Commons licence. </p>
<p>If you like the translations, <a href="http://www.wisdompubs.org/collections/wisdom-academics?f[0]=field_collection%253Aparents_all%3A32" target="_blank">buy the books</a>! (And it wouldn’t hurt to let Wisdom know that you found these teachings via SuttaCentral…)</p>
