    <p>My old friend Ajahn Chandako has written a long letter on the bhikkhuni ordination issue, and it is available on the <a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=8,8666,0,0,1,0">Buddhist Channel</a>. Even though i disagree with most of what he says, I’d encourage you to read the article.</p>
<p>One point I should make clear, though. Ajahn Chandako says that people say the decision to have the ordination done in Bodhinyana was because Ajahn Brahm and myself wanted to go down in history as the gallant saviors of the bhikkhunis. </p>
<p>What actually happened was that several of the nuns, including Ajahn Vayama and Ayya Tathaaloka came to Bodhinyana on the Tuesday, where we discussed a number of suggestions they made. One of these was that the ordination be done at Dhammasara rather than Bodhinyana. The nuns were mainly concerned to do things in a way that would minimize any problems for Ajahn Brahm. </p>
<p>I was neutral on this (for the record, I was not involved in organizing the ordination as such, although I did take part on the day), and so we rang Ajahn Brahm in Norway. He said he would prefer to do the ordination at Bodhinyana, as the <em>sīmā</em> there had been formally set up and recognized, and so he felt that it would be a ‘stronger’ <em>sīmā</em> than one set up for the occasion at Dhammasara. </p>
<p>Ajahn Chandako says he has known me for 17 years, and still he make such claims about my intentions. I guess he really just doesn’t know me at all.</p>
