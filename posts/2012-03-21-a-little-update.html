    <p>Dear bloggists,</p>
<p>You may (or may not) have noticed my absence from the blog for a couple of weeks. No, I wasn’t abducted by aliens. I was very busy, with a sudden death in the family, two trips to Perth, and various other events to keep me occupied. On the writing front, I’ve been working on a long essay on Buddhism and psychotherapy. Also, I’ve finally got around to writing something on marriage equality, a topic I’ve wanted to address for ages. See below!</p>
<p>Thanks for all your comments. I’ll read them as soon as I get the chance, and as always will try to respond as best I can. If, over the next week or so, I haven’t responded to your comment and you still want a response, please help me out by reposting your comment.</p>
