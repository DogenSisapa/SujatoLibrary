    <p>A friend has just sent me <a href="http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2011/08/buddhism-and-empiricism.html" target="_blank">a terrific article on Buddhism and empiricism</a> – thanks, Don! It’s by Carlo Fonseka, and appears in the Sri Lanka Guardian. It gives a very nice summary of the history and role of empiricism in Western philosophy, and goes on to discuss the main contributions towards reconciling Buddhism and empiricism. Kudos for the point that, as empiricism itself is an inexact search for knowledge, any marriage of Buddhism and empiricism can only be partial and problematic – but necessary nonetheless.</p>
