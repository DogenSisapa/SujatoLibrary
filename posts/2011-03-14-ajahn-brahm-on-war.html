    <p>Last week Ajahn Brahm gave two talks at the Roselea Community Center, organized by Santi FM and the Sydney Buddhist community. As with last years talks, these were highly successful. </p>
<p>After the second talk, Ajahn Brahm was asked about war, especially in light of the recent conflict in Sri Lanka. He gave a great response, which <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwIxc1p1QY8">you can see on youtube.</a></p>
