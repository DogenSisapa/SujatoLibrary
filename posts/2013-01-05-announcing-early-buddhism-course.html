    <p>Dear friends, Iâ€™d like to let you know about a course I will be teaching in Sydney in the coming months. It is a series of six day-long workshops on Early Buddhism. I believe it is the first such course offered in Australia. The course will combine teachings, meditations, and discussions. It will give students the chance to gain a broad understanding of Dhamma as taught by the Buddha, as uncovered by historical inquiry.</p>
<p>The course will require registration, and there is a $60 fee to cover the costs of the Buddhist Library. Teachings, of course, are freely offered.</p>
<p>The course will begin on February 17.</p>
<p>Any questions about the course, please leave in the comments.</p>

<p>In addition to this course, I will be resuming a number of sessions in Sydney, starting next week, including Friday night at Well-Aware-Ness, Baulkham Hills on Saturdays, and Parramatta (new venue) on Saturday afternoon. For up-to-date details and dates, check the calendar under the link at the top of this blog. Note that I will be in Sydney only for ten days/month, so these will not be weekly sessions as before!</p>
