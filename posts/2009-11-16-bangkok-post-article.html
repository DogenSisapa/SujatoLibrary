    <p>There’s a fine new <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/27269/bhikkhuni-and-western-sangha-split">article</a> on the bhikkhuni thing by Sanitsuda Ekachai, one of Thailand’s foremost journalists on Buddhism, and a strong and consistent voice for bhikkhunis in Thailand. She cuts straight to the heart of the matter in a way that few others have.</p>
<p>(Please excuse my lazy use of the word ‘thing’. ‘Controversy’, ‘issue’, ‘split’, or whatever, they’ve become such worn currency in my mind. All that’s left is a ‘thing’.)</p>
