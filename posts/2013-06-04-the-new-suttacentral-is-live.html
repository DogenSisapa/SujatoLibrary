    <h1>The new SuttaCentral is&nbsp;live</h1>

    <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://sujato.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-new-suttacentral-is-live/">https://sujato.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-new-suttacentral-is-live/</a></p>
    <p>I have some wonderful news today: our new SuttaCentral is finally live!</p>
<p>You can see it here at: <a href="http://suttacentral.net/" target="_blank" title="SuttaCentral">http://suttacentral.net/</a></p>
<p>We have been working very hard on this for some time now, and are very happy with the results so far. I will be writing on various aspects of this project in the coming weeks, so for now let me just introduce a few of our main features.</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete new design from top to bottom. The whole site, in fact has been rewritten from the ground up.</li>
<li>Much faster more powerful navigation.</li>
<li>Instant search!</li>
<li>Many added new references and improved structure</li>
<li>Many texts are now hosted on site, including the main Suttas of the Pali, the Vietnamese translations, and some English and Korean translations.</li>
<li>Brand new translations from the Saṁykuta Āgama (both the main and shorter version), and the Upāyika. Together with the older translations of the Ekottara and Dīrgha Āgamas, SuttaCentral now has the most comprehensive collection of Āgama translations available anywhere.</li>
<li>We also have newly available online versions of Bhikkhu Bodhi’s classic translations from the Dīgha Nikāya</li>
<li>The Pali and Chinese texts have a very cool instant word lookup function. (We only have <a href="http://suttacentral.net/da21/zh" target="_blank">one Chinese text online for now</a>, more coming soon.)</li>
<li>A very powerful, intuitive pretty URL structure: you can go anywhere on the site directly from the address bar if you know the abbreviated uid for the text.</li>
<li>A Feedback forum: tell us what we can do to make it better! (BTW, while feedback anywhere is good, generally it will be better to leave specific suggestions for the site on that forum rather than here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular readers of this blog will recall that some time ago I complained about how there was no ready good source of Early Buddhist Texts online. Today, we begin to change that.</p>
<p>There are many areas where we want to expand and improve the site, but I hope that it is already something of help for anyone who wants to learn what the Buddha taught.</p>
<p>I have been absent from this blog for some time, as I have wanted to commit myself fully to getting SuttaCentral ready. Now that it is up, I hope to spend some more time back here.</p>
