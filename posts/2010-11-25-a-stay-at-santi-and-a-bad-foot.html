    <p>For all those interested in the inside scoop on a stay at a contemporary forest monastery, have a look at this. <a href="http://themindfulmoment.blogspot.com/2010/11/diary-meditations-in-cave.html">Sometime commenter on this blog Dean Crabb has made an extensive writeup of his recent visit.</a> Complete with videos and photos – and a black snake. Very cool.</p>
<p>On a less happy note, another of our commenters, Lisa Karuna, has injured her foot while visiting relatives in Perth, and had to cancel her visit to Santi. She went through Sydney airport <em>in a wheelchair</em>… It reminds me strangely of an occasion I ended up pushing a bhikkhuni in a wheelchair through Sydney airport… Anyway, let’s dedicate our merit for Lisa and a swift recovery!</p>
