    <p>I’m off this afternoon to teach an Easter metta retreat. I’ve done this for the past few years, so it’s become a bit of a tradition. It’s at the <a href="http://www.bkwsu.org/au/retreats/retreat-locations/Wilton/">Brahma Kumaris center in Wilton</a>, about half-way between Santi and Sydney.</p>
<p>We finalized some important events this week. We’re presenting a public talk by Ajahn Brahm. This is at the Roselea Community center in Beecroft. We’ve chosen this venue as it is near to the demographic center of the Buddhist community in Sydney. Most of Ajahn Brahm’s talks previously have been in the center of Sydney, and many people have been unable to get to them. Make a note of this talk in your diaries, and tell your friends – it’s going to be a great occasion. Like all Santi’s Dhamma talks, it is of course free.</p>
<p>The second event is the philosophy night, which has become a semi-annual event. In previous years we have held an inter-faith dialogue. For this year, we decided on a change of pace, and it will be a dialogue on happiness with a psychiatrist, Dr Eng-kong Tan, and a philosopher, Dr Caroline West. This will be another unique opportunity, so make sure you note it in your diary. This event, like previous philosophy nights, is a charity fundraiser. So we’re charging $20/$10 on the door. All proceeds will go for the Buddhist Library’s <a href="http://www.buddhistlibrary.org.au/cambodia.html">Project Cambodia</a>. I have known this project for several years now, and I know that 100% of donations goes directly to those who are in most need.</p>
