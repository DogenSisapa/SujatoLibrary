    <p>Here’s a message from our good friend Jackie Miller, a former resident of Santi (is that a ‘Santista’?). She’s been on the front lines at Occupy Portland, and sent the following message asking for help for one of the people injured in the protests.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear friends, </p>
<p>My good friend Justin James Bridges was severely injured by police on Nov. 13 during the eviction of Occupy Portland. Justin was defending our right to peacefully assemble by standing in solidarity outside of the Chapman Square camp in downtown Portland when he was pulled into the park by police after falling and injuring his back. Although injured, his hands were zip tied by police and he suffered further injuries while in police custody. Justin is a blues guitarist/singer and was the sign language interpreter for Occupy Portland. His right hand is injured, leaving him without any livelihood until he heals. He has no health insurance and is in need of ongoing care and therapy. He still can’t walk under his own power and has been referred to a neurologist. See <a href="http://occupyportland.org/2011/11/14/missed/" rel="nofollow">http://occupyportland.org/2011/11/14/missed/</a> for more about Justin.</p>
<p>If you feel moved to contribute to medical expenses for Justin, here is the link to his Paypal account. Any amount helps. More importantly, please send good wishes and spread the word via social media, etc. Feel free to call me with questions. </p>
