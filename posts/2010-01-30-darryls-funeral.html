    <p>For all Darryl’s friends out there, his funeral is set at: </p>
<p>Monday the 1st of February at 2pm, Prince Henry Chapel, 50 Pine Ave, Little Bay.</p>
<p>To get to the chapel in Little Bay, head south on Anzac Parade, past the Maroubra turnoff. Turn left into Pine Avenue (at the 2nd newly constructed roundabout — part of the Prince Henry Hospital development). The chapel is at the end of Pine Avenue, with parking on your right.</p>
<p>The chapel’s phone number, if you have trouble finding it, is: 9519 5344. </p>
<p>Following the autopsy, Darryl was found to have had water in his lungs, so he died of drowning. There was no heart attack or similar. It is unknown how such a strong swimmer as Darryl could have drowned.</p>
<p>i hope to see as many of you as I can at the funeral, beside the sea that Darryl loved so well.</p>
