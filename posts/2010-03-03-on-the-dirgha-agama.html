    <h1>On the Dirgha&nbsp;Agama&#8230;</h1>

    <p>A little while ago there was some discussion about the Sarvāstivādin Dīrgha Āgama manuscript, which has come into the hands of scholars in the past ten years or so, and which is slowly being edited for publication. In 2004 Jens-Uwe Hartmann published a paper that discussed and detailed the structure of the Sarv DA.</p>
<p>I contacted Prof. Hartmann to see what had happened since then. He said that there has been no major developments in the past couple of years. One sutra, the Bodhasutra, has been edited but not yet published. And one problem raised in the 2004 paper has been apparently nearly solved: both the Prasadika- and Prasadaniya-sutras are contained in the ms., contrary to the 2004 paper.</p>
<p>Prof. Hartmann has given permission for me to upload a copy of the 2004 paper “<a href="http://sujato.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/da_paper1.pdf">Contents and Structure of the Dirghagama of the (Mula) Sarvastivadins</a>“, Annual Report of The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University 7, 2004, 119-137.</p>
<p>You will notice that this paper refers to the Catusparisat Sutra, which we have discussed in previous threads. The text that Kloppenborg’s translation was made from was that reconstructed by Waldschmidt from texts unearthed in the early 20th century. With the more recent discovery of the larger part of the entire DA, that version, like the versions of the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, etc., will need revision. Since all these texts are in ancient fragments, it’s a huge task to produce a readable text. Now that such a large body of text is available, the task is to re-edit and translate the entire thing. Hopefully in our lifetimes…</p>
