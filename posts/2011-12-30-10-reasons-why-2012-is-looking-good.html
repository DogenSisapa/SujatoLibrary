    <p>The new year is upon us – and a very merry one for all sentient beings!</p>
<p>The doom-mongers will be out in force this year, so let me, as a died-in-the-wool contrarian, offer 10 reasons why 2012 is shaping up to be a great year.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/animal_welfare/l12067_en.htm"><strong>EU is banning factory hens</strong></a>. Ok, that may be a bit overstated, as they are just being allowed some extra space and some other welfare provisions; and there will always be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/dec/29/last-battery-hen-home-liberty">compliance issues</a>, but hey, it’s a start. And provisions for the welfare of other farmed animals is following in the next few years. The appallingly cruel development of factory farming is one of the most vile products of technology, and its end cannot come too soon.</li>
<li><strong>Bhikkhunis keep on happening.</strong> We have seen <a href="http://www.dhammaloka.org.au/home/item/1157-relations-with-the-wat-pa-pong-sangha-worldwide.html">the ending of Wat Pa Pong’s policy</a> of banning monks from Bodhinyana who had participated in bhikkhuni ordination. Next year there will be a large scale bhikkhuni ordination in Vesali. While in Malaysia, I heard many hopeful things about the setting up of a new centre there. Through Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, I heard words of encouragement, gratitude, and support for the bhikkhunis. There’s over 1000 bhikkhunis now in Sri Lanka, and this is just the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Troops are getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan.</strong> Not unproblematic, of course, but surely the only thing that can possibly work in the long term. Perhaps in the future our beloved leaders might reflect first on whether invading foreign countries is the most effective way of making them love democracy and freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Kids TV show <a href="http://au.waybuloo.com/">Waybuloo</a> has got yoga and other cool stuff.</strong> Aww! Cute characters be nice to each other, share hugs and grow flowers, and float when they get happy, which is lots! It must be good, ‘cos the <a href="http://blog.echurchwebsites.org.uk/2009/05/19/cbeebies-waybuloo-christian-response/">fundamentalists hate it</a>.</li>
<li><strong>After the Year of the Protestor, what happens next?</strong> From the Arab Spring to Occupy, people got out on the streets, almost always peacefully, and said, ‘Enough!’ the struggle for freedom, peace, equality and all good things is very far from over, but it is happening. A couple of years ago, who would have guessed? And what will the outcome be for the next year? Since we know that <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18407/why_civil_resistance_works.html">non-violent protest movements are far more successful than violent ones</a>, I think there is a good chance that at least some of the progress will stick.</li>
<li><strong>Fundamentalism is dead.</strong> Alright, not dead yet. But dying. Maybe not dying, but still. Pining for the fjords, at least. The unstoppable wave of ignorance and stupidity in the name of ‘religion’, which dominated global events from the time of 9/11, seems to be on the wane. The Arab Spring and other major shifts, including climate change, are driven by other concerns. The Tea Party candidates are dropping out of the US elections; it seems there is a limit to the lunacy that democracies will tolerate. We might even see a drift back to sanity-based politics. Hopefully this will accompany a more healthy relationship between religion and science.</li>
<li><strong>Technology catches up on global warming.</strong> Even though the political response to the global warming crisis has been an almost unmitigated failure, technology is at least making some headway. <a href="http://energyselfreliantstates.org/content/mapping-solar-grid-parity">This map</a> shows how soon there will be cost parity between solar and current electricity generation in the US. Parity arrives in San Diego in 2014, according to their calculations. For more info, check out <a href="http://www.thefuturemakers.com.au/">The Futuremakers</a>, a great doco on emerging energy technologies by my old friend Maryella Hatfield.</li>
<li><strong>More people are meditating than ever before.</strong> At least in the US: “A <a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm#research">2007 national Government survey</a> that asked about CAM use in a sample of 23,393 U.S. adults found that 9.4 percent of respondents (representing more than 20 million people) had used meditation in the past 12 months—compared with 7.6 percent of respondents (representing more than 15 million people) in a similar survey conducted in 2002.” That’s nearly 25% increase in 5 years. The growth of meditation worldwide is perhaps the most significant thing ever in the history of humanity. For the first time, a large percentage of people, of all nationalities and religions, and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-06-07-meditate_N.htm">in all kinds of settings</a>, are consciously and deliberately making efforts to purify and expand their consciousness. No-one knows what the possible outcomes of this will be – but it will be more than just a little short term stress reduction.</li>
<li><strong>Violence continues to decline.</strong> We have discussed Steven Pinker’s argument that violence is, on the whole, in decline. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence.html">He continues to make his case</a>, and statistics argue in favor of many of his key points. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate">homicide rates worldwide continue to decline</a>. here’s hoping that 2012 will be humanity’s most peaceful ever.</li>
<li><strong>The prophets will be wrong, again!</strong> Here’s counting down to Dec 20, 2012, when the world is going to end and all the usual yada yada. Me, I’ll be kicking back here at Santi with a lovely cup of coffee and a nice ‘told you so’. You’re welcome to join!</li>
</ul>
<p>So there’s ten. What other great things can we look forward to in 2012?</p>
