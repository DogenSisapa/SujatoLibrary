    <p><a href="http://sujato.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mongkut-and-dhammayut-modern-trend.pdf">Here’s</a> an interesting account of Thai Buddhist history, focusing on the reforms by Phra Mongkut in the mid-19th century. </p>
<p>The author, Phra Anil Sakya (Sugandha), is a Nepalese bhikkhu who was the secretary for the Sangharaja in Thailand, and is now holding an academic post. He notes that Mongkut himself used the term ‘dhammayut’ to mean one who is practicing correctly in accord with the Buddha himself, whose teachings are to be studied through a critical and close examination of the texts, clearly distinguishing between authentic and inauthentic. His son, Phra Vajiraṇāṇa, praised one of the leading figures in the early Dhammayut, saying, ‘Somdet Phra Vanarat likes changing, a true nature of Dhammayut Order.’</p>
