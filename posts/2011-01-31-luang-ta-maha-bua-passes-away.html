    <p>This sad news was published in the Thai Nation today.</p>
<blockquote><p>Highly revered monk Luangta Maha Bua Yanasampanno passed away early Sunday. He was 98 years old.<br/>
His followers at Wat Pa Ban Tad in Udon Thani said the abbot of the temple died at 3:53 am.<br/>
Luangta Maha Bua was born Bua Lohitdee on August 12, 1913 in Ban Tad, Udon Thani’s Mak Khaeng district to a well-to-do farming family and had 15 siblings. At the age of 20, he was ordained as a monk on May 12, 1934, at Wat Yothanimit, according to the Thai tradition for his parents’ merit.</p>
<p>Luangta Maha Bua, who was a student of much-respected Luangpu Man Phurithatto, is renowned for leading many fund-raising events for charitable causes and helping to restore the country’s national reserves after they were depleted in the “Tom Yam Gung” financial crisis in 1997-98.</p></blockquote>
<p>Luang Ta Maha Bua was one of the great monks, indeed great human beings, of the last century, and his passing away signals the end of an era. He has said for years that people should not mourn his death, as he has long gone beyond rebirth. Fierce and funny, profound and unique, he was a true original. May he rest in Nibbbana!</p>
