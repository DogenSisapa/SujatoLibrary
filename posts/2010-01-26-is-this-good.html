    <p>I’ve just changed the theme of the blog, in response to the remarks some time ago that the previous style was hard to read for some people, as the font was not dark enough. I’ve had a look through the available WordPress themes, and this seems to be the one with the clearest text. It’s not fancy, but I think it’s readable. Let me know if this is ok, or if anyone has a suggestion that might work better. </p>
<p>UPDATE: After some feedback about the previous choice (The Journalist), I’m trying this one (Ocadia). The font is a little larger and the lines are shorter, more traditional book line length (12-15 words). It’s also a bit softer, not as stark and glarey. Feedback?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/searching-for-happiness--how-we-count-the-ways-20100124-msm0.html">here’s</a> an article from the Sydney Morning herald about a gig I did last Sunday – the ‘World Cafe’ on happiness, as a part of the Sydney Festival.</p>
