    <p>When you meditate, just relax. </p>
<p>Don’t try to control your mind. </p>
<p>Don’t try to stop it going here and there. </p>
<p>Just be peaceful. </p>
<p>Don’t watch your breath. Just breathe. </p>
<p>Be at peace when your mind is still. Be at peace when your mind is wandering. </p>
<p>Don’t judge one state as better than the other. It is just how the mind is. </p>
<p>Let mindfulness settle down with the breath. </p>
<p>As you stop judging, stop trying, and stop controlling, peace will come to you. </p>
<p>Welcome it.</p>
