    <p>It’s been mentioned a few times in the comments, but i thought i should make a proper post for it: the <a href="http://new.ipetitions.com/petition/bhikkhuni-ordination/">bhikkhuni petition</a>. It’s been lovingly hand-crafted by a group of bhikkhuni supporters around the world, and is a sincere, heart-felt plea for gender equity in the Sangha. As i write, there are 832 signatures – wow! Please do your bit and add your name.</p>
