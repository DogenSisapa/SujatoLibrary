    <h1>UK Murder rate rose 5% last&nbsp;year?</h1>
    <p><em>2012-01-20T12:09:22</em></p>
    <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/murder-rate-rose-5-last-year/">https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/murder-rate-rose-5-last-year/</a></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/19/murder-rate-rose-5-percent">So says the Guardian</a>, normally one of the more reliable sources of news around. </p>
<p>But, adds the subheading, overall crimes are stable, or even falling despite the August riots. Of course, since many people won’t get as far as the subheading, they’ll miss this point.</p>
<p>And the 5% increase in murder rate? It’s actually a 5% increase in the <em>number</em> of murders in the year. The murder rate is the number of murders in a year per population. So what is happening to the murder rate?</p>
<p>Here’s Wikipedia’s data on the murder rates in the UK from 2000-2009: (This data is convenient to copy here, but note that it is not identical with the Home Office’s figures, available <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0212/">here</a>.</p>

<p>So the murder rate has been falling for a decade. And the ‘5% increase’ is compared with 2009/2010, which had the lowest number of murders in 11 years, according to the Guardian; but according to the <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0212/">Home Office’s own figures</a>, 2010 was the lowest since 1990. In fact the UK murder rate has been pretty much stable, apart from an increase for a few years around 2002, since the 1960s. The Home Office analysis discusses the trends in homicide:</p>
<blockquote><p>One can assess from this analysis that the number of homicide incidents recorded in 2010/11 was not statistically significantly different to the number of homicide incidents in 2009/10 or 2008/09, despite the actual number of incidents having risen by three per cent since 2009/10. However, the number of homicide incidents recorded in 2010/11 was statistically significantly lower than the number of incidents recorded in 2006/07 and 2007/08, and those recorded between 2000/01 and 2004/05. This means the risk of becoming a victim of homicide was, in fact, lower for 2010/11 compared with those earlier years.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there’s no statistical significance to the increase. Oh, and this also clarifies that actual increase in murder rates, as opposed to number of murders, was 3%, not 5%.</p>
<p>So the Guardian’s heading was both factually wrong and misleading. The actual situation is that crime levels are fairly stable in the long term. But even for a respectable media outlet like the Guardian, that doesn’t make much of a headline.</p>
<p>All this is just one example of a trend in the (mis)reporting of violence and crime. We are constantly being told how the world is getting more violent – but the statistics tell a different story.</p>
<p>Do you have any other examples?</p>
