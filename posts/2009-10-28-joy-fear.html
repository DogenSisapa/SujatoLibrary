    <p>I’ve have received responses from around the world to our bhikkhuni ordination. Overwhelmingly, they express two dominant emotions: joy and fear.</p>
<p>Joy at the ordination, joy for the bhikkhunis, joy for the courage of Ajahn Brahm and the Sangha, joy that there is still a hope for Buddhism in our future.</p>
<p>And fear at what someone will say or do if they find out, fear of the consequences: ‘don’t quote me, don’t say I contacted you, don’t let word get back to the monks of what I’ve done’.</p>
<p>Ajahn Brahm and the Sangha who supported the bhikkhuni ordination have unleashed a wave of joy. But where does the fear come from? What are they afraid of? How can a tiny group of elite monks generate such an ocean of silence? </p>
