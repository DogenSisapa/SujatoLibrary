    <p>It’s been pretty gloomy here recently, so here’s some good news! <a href="http://www.thebuddhism.net/2013/07/19/buddhism-in-congo-africa/" target="_blank">From TheBuddhism.net</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhu Bodhiraja who is a Congo citizen ordained only just five years ago, yet he has been a huge service to the order of Buddhism in Congo. He was able to build four Buddhist temples in main cities of Kongo due to his dedicated work. Bhikkhu Bodhiraja is acting with the guidance of Ilukpitiye Pannashekara thero who is currently residing in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Bhikkhu Bodhiraja could gain considerable amount of attention of the Cong people and many who seek spiritual development have become devoted Buddhists already. A Bodhi tree also has been planted in Congo , which is a branch of the bodhi tree in Tanzania planted in 1920.</p>
<p>We wish all the blessings of triple gems, the protection of Devas, physical and mental happiness to be with Bhikkhu Bodhiraja to spread the peace message of the Gauthama Buddha to as much as intelligent living beings.</p>
