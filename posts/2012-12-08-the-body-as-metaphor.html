    <h1>The body as&nbsp;metaphor</h1>

    <p>While we’re on the topic of misconstrued meditative metaphors, here’s another chestnut that well and truly deserves roasting: the body. The formula for third jhana mentions that one ‘experiences bliss with the body’. Most interpretations of jhanas say that they are purely mental experiences, based on the unification of mind-consciousness, and that it is impossible to experience anything through the five senses while in such a state. </p>
<p>But then, we can’t just have everybody agreeing on everything, can we, because that would be just so so dull. So others take the word body quite literally here, and say that this shows that we can experience the body (and other physical senses) in jhana. </p>
<p>You’re probably guessing that I’m going to side with the non-literalists here, and you’re quite right. I’ve discussed this in more detail elsewhere, but I just noticed this little sutta that brings out the metaphorical nature of the language used in higher Dhammas quite nicely. Here it is, Anguttara 4.189.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bhikkhus, these four are things to be realized. What four?</p>
<p>There are things to be realized with the body, to be realized with mindfulness, to be realized with the eye and to be realized with wisdom.</p>
<p>What should be realized with the body? The eight liberations.</p>
<p>What should be realized with mindfulness? Previous births.</p>
<p>What should be realized with the eye? The passing away and rebirth of beings.</p>
<p>What should be realized with wisdom? The ending of defilements.</p>
<p>Bhikkhus, these four are things to be realized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice especially here the use of ‘body’ and ‘eye’. Now, it is clearly quite impossible that ‘eye’ means a physical eye here; no-one would argue that one can physically see beings getting reborn. In this context of subtle, abstruse, higher Dhammas, the eye is not a physical eye, but a metaphor for a refined inner vision. </p>
<p>And in just the same way, the body is not a physical body, but a metaphor for the wholeness and directness of experience. As if this were not obvious enough from the context, notice that the things to be realized with the body are the eight liberations, which include the four formless attainments. These are by definition beyond any kind of physical reality. Elsewhere, the Buddha says that even Nibbana is to be realized with the body.</p>
<p>The body is not the body, the eye is not the eye, and thought is not thought. These are all <em>words</em>, inadequate, struggling, messy words, creeping up from the evolutionary slime, groping and grasping towards the light. As long as we keep them weighed down by the mundane, we can never speak of higher things. And since these higher things are things of the mind, if we cannot speak of them, we cannot imagine them. And if we cannot imagine them, we cannot realize them. And that is rather a sad state of affairs.</p>
