    <p>I was on a Qantas flight from Perth back to Sydney yesterday morning, after the wonderful bhikkhuni ordination at Bodhinyana. A woman sitting in a seat behind me said to the flight steward: ‘Excuse me, sir.’</p>
<p>He turned and said: ‘Did you just call me “sir”?’</p>
<p>A little surprised, she said: ‘Uhh, yes…’</p>
<p>He paused a moment, then smiled and said: ‘Would you mind doing it again?’</p>
<p>I love Australia.</p>
