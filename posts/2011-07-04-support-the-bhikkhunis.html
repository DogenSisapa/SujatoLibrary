    <p>A few days ago I got an emails from a bhikkhuni that really made me sit up. she said that her center receives only about $2000 in donations each year. There is plenty of on-the-ground support through volunteers and dana, but that’s not much money to run a center…</p>
<p>This highlights the stark reality of the difference between the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. Most bhikkhus never really know what it is like to go without. Even if we stay in a simple place, we know very well that if we want to go somewhere comfortable, we can any time. Bhikkhunis can’t. The places hardly exist yet, and unless we decide to support them, they never will.</p>
<p>Many of you may be aware of the <a href="http://www.bhikkhuni.net/directory.html">Alliance for Bhikkhunis</a> that has been set up in the US. One of their tasks is to help facilitate support for bhikkhunis around the world. Please do get in touch with them and offer what support you can for the bhikkhunis. We can’t build a four-fold Sangha without you.</p>
