<h3>JUSTICE FOR PHULMAYA: GANG RAPISTS SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS</h3>
<p>On 9 January 2012, the final court hearing against a bus driver and other bus company employees charged with gang raping a young Buddhist nun (“Phulmaya”) in Nepal took place. The Sankhuwasabha District Court pronounced judgment in favor of Phulmaya, who is represented by FWLD, and delivered its verdict against the accused. The court sentenced four of the perpetrators to 12 years of imprisonment and compensation of Rs. 50,000 (Nepali Rupees) each, on charges of rape. The fifth accused has been sentenced to six years ofimprisonment for attempted rape. All five of the accused have been ordered by the Court to equally compensate Phulmaya for the Rs. 130,000 (Nepali Rupees) that they robbed from her. FWLD Founder Sapana Pradhan Malla and Nepali “singing nun” Ani Choying recently visited Phulmaya and delivered funds that Donor Direct Action had raised on her behalf. She was very grateful. Since the July 2011 rape, she has been improving, is happy with the school she is in and wants to continue her education there because she is with other Buddhist nuns. </p></blockquote>
