    <p>I’ve been a bit slow in blogging recently, for which I have various excuses. Not many ideas I wanted to write about. Also I’ve been working on my long-term project, a book called White Bones, Red Rot, Black Snakes. I might publish some excerpts from that here if any strike me as being suitable.</p>
<p>And we’re into our study period here at Santi! This is an idea we started last year. Just as we have the three months vassa for a meditation retreat, we have a three month study period. During this time we have classes on most days. Our program this year is:</p>
<p>Monday: Pali; Vinaya (working from the Uposathakkhandhaka to begin)<br/>
Tuesday: Suttas (We’re doing a detailed study of the Samaññaphala Sutta, which should take the whole three months)<br/>
Wednesday: Dhamma/meditation talk<br/>
Thursday: Buddhist history (Last year we went from the origins of history up to the Abhidhamma. This year we’re looking at the post-canonical Buddhist developments, starting with the Milindapañha)<br/>
Sunday: TED video and discussion (last week we looked at a presentation on the psychology of decision making) </p>
<p>Anyway, this is just to let you know what’s been going on. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, how about another open question post. What’s been on your mind?</p>
