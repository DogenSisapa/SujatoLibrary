    <p>I’m sure most of you have heard that the <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/mary_mackillop_to_become_first_australian_saint/">Roman Church</a> has finally declared they will canonize Mary MacKillop, who will become the first officially recognized <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2010/02/22/lessons-in-history-the-little-aussie-battler-whos-heading-for-sainthood/">Australian saint</a>. </p>
<p>It’s great that such an honor has gone to a woman who genuinely worked hard all her life for the welfare of others. And the minor detail that she was <a href="http://users.senet.com.au/~nparish/stories/mary_mackillop.htm">excommunicated</a> for alleged insubordination just adds relevance to the mix. The Church realized its mistake and undid the excommunication (is this “de-excommunicate” or “re-communicate”?), but the episode starkly shows the battles that reformers undergo when they try to extend the comfortable boundaries of religious conventions. Adelaide people still remember how she was <a href="http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7014&amp;CFID=29711630&amp;CFTOKEN=52314760">supported by local Jewish and Anglican benefactors</a> during her period of excommunication, an example of Adelaide’s proud history of social harmony.</p>
