    <p>Regular contributor to this blog, Dean, has started a new movement, <a href="http://www.themomentofpeace.com/">‘A Moment of Peace’</a>. The goal is for a million people to spend 1 hour in mindful silence at 8:00pm, Saturday 18th June 2011. I’m on retreat at that time, so count me in! Check out the website and see how to contribute.</p>
