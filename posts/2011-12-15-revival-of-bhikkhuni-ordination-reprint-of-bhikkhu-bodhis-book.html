    <p>Inward Path Publishers of Penang have republished Bhikkhu Bodhi’s classic argument for the revival of bhikkhuni ordination, originally written for the bhikkhuni congress in Hamburg, 2008. Thanks, Hock Eng! <a href="http://inwardpathpublisher.blogspot.com/2011/12/this-is-wonderful-slideshow-of.html">Here’s the page on their website</a>; it includes some useful links, and a nice refutation of some misconceptions regarding bhikkhuni ordination by Malaysia’s Barbara Yen.</p>
