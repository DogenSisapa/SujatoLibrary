    <p>The origin of the Zen school is traditionally traced to Mahakassapa, who was said to have received a direct transmission outside the scriptures. This transmission is illustrated with the evocative story of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_Sermon">Buddha holding a flower</a> silently before the assembled Sangha: only Mahakassapa understood, and smiled. The story is gains special resonance since Mahakassapa is renowned as a curmudgeonly old monk – although his authentic verses in the Theragatha do indeed show a delightful love of nature.</p>
<p>Despite the fame and importance of the story, it is not attested in any Indic scripture, and is a Chinese Chan invention. It’s first appearance is apparently in the compilation of koans, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gateless_Gate#Case_6:_Buddha_Twirls_a_Flower">無門關</a> (Wúménguān, often rendered in English as The Gateless Gate), compiled by the Chinese Zen master Wumen Hui-k’ai (無門慧開) and first published in 1228. The development of the notion of lineages is discussed by <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=9CYeWYtYBS4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dumoulin,+Heinrich+(2005),+Zen+Buddhism:+A+History,+1:+India+and+China&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L8bYTamkH5CmvgPZ1LTCBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=true%20form%20of%20the%20formless&amp;f=false">Dumoulin</a>.</p>
