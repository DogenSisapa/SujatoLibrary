    <p>I’m on my way to another environmental event, the launch of the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change’s policy paper. It’s a great paper, strong, well argued, and convincing.</p>
<p>But it gets hard to find words sometimes. How to say what is so obvious? Consumption doesn’t make you happy – how can anyone not get that, really? How many times do we have to keep pointing at the bleeding obvious? Until it really does start to bleed, I guess.</p>
<p>Floods, cyclones, fires: the end does seem a little more nigh than is comfortable. Of course, we can’t pin any one event down to climate change, any more than we can blame cancer on any one cigarette. One thing is sure: the past months in Australia are just a taste of what’s to come.</p>
<p>How much do we need to do? More, that’s for certain. The Buddhist scriptures pin climate change down to one thing: insatiable human greed. We have to start wanting less.</p>
