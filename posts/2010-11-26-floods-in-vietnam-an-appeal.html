<p>Dear friends,</p>
<blockquote><p>Dukkhappatta ca niddukkha<br/>
Sokappatta ca nissoka<br/>
Bhayappatta ca nibbhaya<br/>
Hontu sukhi sabbepi panino</p></blockquote>
<p>The Buddha’s teaching on universal love (Metta &amp; Karuna) resonates in every soul. In many discourses, he recommended us to express our love and care for our fellow human &amp; animals, especially, the deprived beings whether by natural disasters or by social injustice, we should make an effort helping them to rise up from suffering. We spread good-will (<em>mettaṃ mano kammaṃ</em>), say kind words <em>(mettaṃ vāci kammaṃ</em>), and effectively reach out to them (<em>mettaṃ kāya kammaṃ</em>) as the words in Karaniyametta Sutta say: “this unlimited love should spread all over the world without stint or reservation…”</p>
<p>In the last two months there were storms and over rainfall causing many floods in central Vietnam where most of the affected are farmers. Hundreds of people &amp; thousands of animals were killed &amp; many thousand homes were destroyed. All their crops have been destroyed and washed away. They will continue to suffer from food shortage and diseases related to long term floods for many months to come.</p>
<p>Your generosity will help them to rise up from their sorrow &amp; fear in poverty. Ven. Dhammananda is co-ordinating in collecting aids to these victims. You can help them by deposit into this account for the victims of flood.</p>
