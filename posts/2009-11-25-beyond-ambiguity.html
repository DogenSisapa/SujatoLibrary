    <p>Just a few miscellaneous items for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/dhammadharini/web/beyond-ambiguity?pli=1">Here’s</a> a wonderful new article by Ayya Tathaaloka. She has a wonderful way of capturing both the spirit and the sense of things. Do have a read.</p>
<p>There’s been some interest in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s paper on bhikkhuni ordination. Here’s the full paper, including the appendix, which translates Jetavana Sayadaw’s argument for bhikkhuni ordination.</p>

<p>My friends over at the Singapore Buddhist fellowship have a lot of interesting bhikkhuni materials on their <a href="http://www.buddhistfellowship.org/">website</a>, check it out.</p>
<p>Some of you may be aware of a recent article by Ajahn Thanissaro where he questions the validity of the recent ordinations. His article has been criticized by Ayya Tathaaloka, Ayya Sudhamma, Ajahn Brahm, Bhikkhu Bodhi, and I understand that a group of scholars is also preparing a response. This is so great – for once I don’t have to do it myself! I don’t know if there is a place on the web where all these articles are collected together for easy reference? If someone could point me in the right direction I can put up some links – there’s a bit too much material for me to want to post it all here. </p>
