    <p>Today’s the 75th birthday of the Dalai Lama. All our best wishes go out to him – and thanks to the activist organization Avaaz, we can send a personal message on his birthday. <a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/dalai_lamas_birthday/?cl=642477912&amp;v=6731">Follow this link and sign on the global tribute</a>, and your message will be included in a ‘Wall of Warm Wishes’ inside the main temple at Dharamsala and broadcast around the world. </p>
