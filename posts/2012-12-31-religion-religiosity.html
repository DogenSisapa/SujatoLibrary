    <p>Some interesting news in international religions today. Perhaps the most astonishing event over Christmas was that the Pope chose his Christmas message, the one directed inwards <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1205341.htm" target="_blank">for the officials of the Roman Curia, the Catholic Church’s central administrative offices at the Vatican</a>, to attack same sex marriage.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the same man who, the week before, <a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/638115-speaker-kadaga-receives-blessings-from-pope.html" target="_blank">gave a special blessing to Rebecca Kadaga</a>, the Speaker of the House in Uganda’s Parliament, who in an interview with Reuters said that she would ensure that the gaol-the-gays bill (formerly known as the “kill-the-gays bill”) would be passed, as a “<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/11/13/uk-uganda-homosexuality-idUKBRE8AC0VC20121113" target="_blank">Christmas gift</a>” for the Ugandan people.</p>
<p>The Pope’s message repeated the dualistic determinism theory of human nature: we are created man &amp; woman and there can therefore be no other form of marriage. He denies that marriage is about a social construct, but is inherent in human nature. Apparently without irony, the celibate Pope said that as the commitment to traditional family declines, “essential elements of the experience of being human are lost”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in unrelated news, <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/331306#tab=comments&amp;sc=0" target="_blank">people around the world continue to turn away from religion</a>. In striking confirmation of Marx, there is a strong positive correlation between religious belief and poverty, lack of education, and <a href="http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi-data/" target="_blank">violence</a>. A <a href="http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf" target="_blank">recent WIN-Gallup meta-study</a> confirms these long term trends.</p>
<p>The study does not cover all countries, and, presumably through accident rather than design, it omits Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Laos, and Cambodia: all of the Theravada countries. Most of what it says about religion, therefore, cannot be extrapolated to Theravada. It is still the case that the phrasing of the questions leave Buddhists out in the cold: are you religious or atheist? All Buddhists are atheists in the sense of not believing in a Creator God. Until those doing the surveys get a better methodology we may never really know how Buddhism fits with these worldwide trends. </p>
<p>The only interesting snippet regarding Buddhism in the survey was that Buddhists rank by far the highest in the answer to the question, “Do you regard yourself as a religious person” 97% of Buddhists agreed with this, as opposed to around 80% for most Christian denominations, 74% for Muslims, and 38% for Jews. Given the problems with the survey as far as Buddhists are concerned, I wouldn’t want to read too much into this, however.</p>
