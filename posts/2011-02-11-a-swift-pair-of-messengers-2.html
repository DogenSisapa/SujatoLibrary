    <p>I’ve finally got around to putting up <a href="http://santipada.org/aswiftpairofmessengers/"><em>A Swift Pair of Messengers</em></a> in various formats, especially as a print=on-demand book from Lulu.com. I promised these many months ago, optimistically saying they’d be ready in ‘a few days’! The hardcover from Lulu is really excellent, I’m very impressed with their quality.</p>
<p>Actually, I’ve been preparing all my old books, and one new one, for publication through Lulu.com. I’m awaiting the next round of proof copies from Lulu and hopefully will get these available in… well, perhaps best not to mention a time frame.</p>
<p>There was some <a href="http://sujato.wordpress.com/2010/07/21/a-swift-pair-of-messengers/">terrific discussion on this after my last post</a>, and if anyone has more comments or questions, that can be continued here. I notice that I didn’t answer everyone’s questions, so I’ll try to get on to that. If I don’t answer your question, please post it again, sometimes I miss things!</p>
