    <p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>We have finally prepared the detailed reading list for next year’s course in Karma &amp; Rebirth in Early Buddhism.</p>
<p>As with the Early Buddhism Course in 2013, this will be presented each month in parallel at the BSWA by myself and Ajahn Brahmali, and in Sydney by myself alone (unless anyone can persuade Ajahn Brahmali to come to Sydney! That would be very good kamma!)</p>
<p>You can download the reading and other course details from here:  </p>

<h3>Use Discourse!</h3>
<p>For this year, we are facilitating a discussion and exchange around the course using the new forum platform, Discourse. This is something that we have been developing in the background for SuttaCentral. The integration with SuttaCentral is not complete, but it’s ready enough to be used for this course. Ultimately we’d like this forum to be a place where all kinds of material related to the suttas can be gathered and made accessible. </p>
<p>If you’re interested in the course, register at discourse.suttacentral.net, and you can join the online community, discuss issues, ask questions, and so on. This is especially useful for anyone interested in following the course online, but we hope it will be fun for everyone.</p>
<p>To get started, have a look at the course outline for the first workshop: myth-busting. If anyone has any myths they want busted, please let us know!</p>
