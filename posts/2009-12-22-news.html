    <p>Bhikkhuni ordination remains in the news, with front page articles in the leading Thai papers <a href="http://www.thairath.co.th/content/edu/53976">Thai Rath</a> and <a href="http://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1261235531&amp;grpid=00&amp;catid=">Matichon</a>.</p>
<p>A tabloid-style blog from the <a href="http://www.alittlebuddha.com/html/The%20Vision%20of%20P.M.Narin/The%20Vision%20of%20Phramaha%20Narin%20101.html">Wat Thai Las Vegas</a> (!) has published a scathing condemnation of Ajahn Brahm, calling him a ‘fool’ (<em>moghapurisa</em>) in the headline. This website has some pretty lurid stuff; the current leading article screams: <a href="http://www.alittlebuddha.com/">“Monk Kills Monk!”</a>, with a big picture of a gun and bullets.</p>
<p>There has been some discussion about the content of these articles. I’m not sure that they add anything new, as it’s hard to say what truth has survived the tabloid treatment. But there is the impression that the Walters are continuing their efforts, and some say the Walters believe the existing expulsion is not enough and are seeking to have Ajahn Brahm emoved as abbot of Bodhinyana. Others say there has been an explicit ban on performing sanghakamma, or Thai monks visiting Bodhinyana. I’m taking all this with a grain of salt for now; I’ve heard very different things from other, more reliable, channels. The official website of the Mahatherasamakhom simply acknowledges that Bodhinyana has been expelled from Wat Pa Pong (see point 34 on <a href="http://www.mahathera.org/detail.php?module=news&amp;id=46&amp;title=02">this page</a>). It does not mention Ajahn Brahm or bhikkhunis</p>
<p>There is a supportive opinion piece by an influential columnist in the <a href="http://www.thairath.co.th/column/pol/chuckthong/54190">Thai Rath</a>.</p>
<p>Sanitsuda Ekachai, having stimulated a vibrant exchange with a <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/blogs/index.php/2009/11/20/sangha-split-opens-door-for-women?blog=64">previous article</a>, has written <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/blogs/index.php?blog=64">another breathtakingly honest and clear-sighted article</a> for the Bangkok Post.</p>
<p>Australian media is belatedly catching up, with an article in the <a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/6613624/wa-buddhists-expelled-over-women/">West Australian</a>. Notice the delightfully relevant stock photo of Bodhinyana monks with a fire truck!</p>
