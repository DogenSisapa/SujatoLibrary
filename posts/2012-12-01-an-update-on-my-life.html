    <p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>After my vassa with my dad, I was till (quite deliberately) at a loose end. With no plan in mind, I went to Sydney where, after a couple of days, a voice from the gods (a metaphor voice, if you’re wondering) spoke to me and said, “Go to Bodhinyana!” So I did, and here I am.</p>
<p>It’s lovely to be back and staying with the monks here again. The bush is thin and scrappy, just how it should be; and the kangaroos are, if possible, brassier than ever.</p>
<p>I’m enjoying my between-time, and the monks here are pretty together, so there’s not much for me to do. I’ve been helping out with a little teaching here and there, and spending a lot of time in my kuti practicing. To satisfy my scholarly bent, I’ve been working with the <a href="http://www.suttacentral.net/" target="_blank">Suttacentral</a> team on an updated version of our Sutta correspondence site. You’ll see the shiny new version soon.</p>
<p>I have started thinking about next year, and I’d like to get back to Sydney regularly. I’m thinking, maybe spend 10 days a month in Sydney giving teachings and so on, and the remainder of the month here. We’ll see.</p>
<p>I’m also looking to get back to some more regular blogging, so hopefully you’ll see a few more articles coming up.</p>
