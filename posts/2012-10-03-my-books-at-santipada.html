    <h1>My books at&nbsp;Santipada</h1>
    <p><em>2012-10-03T12:01:02</em></p>
    <p><strong>Original:</strong> <a href="https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/my-books-at-santipada/">https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/my-books-at-santipada/</a></p>
    <p>The final versions of all six of my books* are finished and available through <a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/category/books/" target="_blank">Santipada.org</a>.</p>
<p>These books have been a labour of love for me, and are the fruits of countless hours of perspiration and inspiration. I’ve done everything I can to ensure that they are as well written, researched, and presented as possible, and I make them available as widely as I can. You can read them on the web, download them, get an ebook, and even, for the traditionalists among you, order a paperback version. Here’s the blurb for each of these books.</p>
<p>I don’t have any way of publicizing these apart from this blog, so I’d really appreciate it if you’d spread these around on whatever network or social media you use. On the Santipada site I encourage donations to Buddhist Global Relief, and the (minimal) proceeds from book sales go to Santi FM.**</p>
<h3><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/white-bones-red-rot-black-snakes/" target="_blank">White Bones Red Rot Black Snakes</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/white-bones-red-rot-black-snakes/"><img alt="" class="alignleft" height="181" src="../media/wbrrbsCOVERebook.jpg" title="White Bones Red Rot Black Snakes" width="120.0"/></a>Enchant­ing, power­ful, hor­rific, beau­ti­ful, wise, deadly, com­pas­sion­ate, seduct­ive. Women in Buddhist story and image are all these things and more. She takes the signs of the ancient god­dess – the lotus, the sac­red grove, the ser­pent, the sac­ri­fice – and uses them in aston­ish­ing new ways. Her story is one of suf­fer­ing and great tri­als, and through it all an unquench­able long­ing to be free. This beau­ti­fully illus­trated work is as layered and sub­vers­ive as myth­o­logy itself. Based dir­ectly on authen­tic Buddhist texts, and informed with insights from psy­cho­logy and com­par­at­ive myth­o­logy, it takes a fresh look at how Buddhist women have been depic­ted by men and how they have depic­ted themselves.</p>
<h3><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/dreams-of-bhadda/" target="_blank">Dreams of Bhadda</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/dreams-of-bhadda/"><img alt="" class="alignleft" height="150" src="../media/dobCOVERebook-225x300.jpg" title="Dreams of Bhadda" width="112.5"/></a>Bhaddā was a true ori­ginal. An ascetic, a philo­sopher, and a mur­derer, who became one of the best-loved of all the bhikkhunis. Here is a vivid re-imagining of her story: a Buddhist nun like you’ve never seen before.</p>

<h3><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/a-history-of-mindfulness/" target="_blank">A History of Mindfulness</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/a-history-of-mindfulness/"><img alt="" class="alignleft" height="160" src="../media/homCOVERebook.jpg" title="A History of Mindfulness" width="120"/></a>The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is the most influ­en­tial scrip­ture in Buddhist med­it­a­tion. It is the found­a­tion text for the mod­ern schools of ‘vipas­sanā’ or ‘insight’ med­it­a­tion. The well-known Pali dis­course is, how­ever, only one of many early Buddhist texts that deal with mind­ful­ness. This is the first full-scale study to encom­pass all extant ver­sions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, tak­ing into account the dynamic evol­u­tion of the Buddhist scrip­tures and the broader Indian med­it­at­ive cul­ture. A new vis­ion emerges from this ground­break­ing study: mind­ful­ness is not a sys­tem of ‘dry insight’ but is the ‘way to con­ver­gence’ lead­ing the mind to deep states of peace.</p>
<h3><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/sects-sectarianism/" target="_blank">Sects &amp; Sectarianism</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/sects-sectarianism/"><img alt="" class="alignleft" height="160" src="../media/ssCOVERebook.jpg" title="Sects &amp; Sectarianism" width="120"/></a>Why are there so many schools of Buddhism? Are the dif­fer­ences just cul­tural, or do they have fun­da­ment­ally dif­fer­ent vis­ions of Dhamma? This work assesses the claims of the tra­di­tions, and takes into account to find­ings of mod­ern schol­ar­ship. It pays spe­cial atten­tion to the ori­gins of the mon­astic orders. If we are to under­stand the dif­fer­ences, and some­times ten­sions, between the schools of Buddhism today, we must exam­ine more closely the forces that spurred their formation.</p>
<h3><a href="http://santipada.org/aswiftpairofmessengers/" target="_blank">A Swift Pair of Messengers</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://santipada.org/aswiftpairofmessengers/"><img alt="" class="alignleft" height="160" src="../media/spmCOVERebook-225x300.jpg" title="A Swift Pair of Messengers" width="120"/></a>Serenity and insight are the two great wings of Buddhist med­it­a­tion. They each have a spe­cial role to play in the path to Awaken­ing. While some mod­ern approaches seek to mar­gin­al­ize serenity in favor of ‘dry’ insight, the Buddha’s own dis­courses place serenity right at the cen­ter of the path. This book col­lects vir­tu­ally all the sig­ni­fic­ant pas­sages on this topic that are found in the early dis­courses, care­fully elu­cid­ated for the mod­ern reader.</p>
<h3><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/bhikkhuni-vinaya-studies/" target="_blank">Bhikkhuni Vinaya Studies</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/bhikkhuni-vinaya-studies/"><img alt="" class="alignleft" height="180.8" src="../media/bvssantipadaMAIN.jpg" title="Bhikkhuni Vinaya Studies" width="120"/></a>Although his­tor­ic­ally mar­gin­al­ized, Buddhist nuns are tak­ing their place in mod­ern Buddhism. Like the monks, Buddhist nuns live by an ancient sys­tem of mon­astic law, the Vinaya. This work invest­ig­ates vari­ous areas of uncer­tainty and con­tro­versy in how the Vinaya is to be under­stood and applied today.<br/>

<p>In addition to these books, I have updated and improved two old websites on bhikkhuni ordination: <a href="http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/sikkhamana-the-two-years-training-for-buddhist-nuns/" target="_blank">Sikkhamana and Bhikkhuni Patimokkha</a>. These consist mainly of translations and comparative tables for those interested in a serious study of issues relating to bhikkhuni ordination.</p>

<p>* Not counting the illustrated book Beginnings, which was previously available at <a href="http://www.budaedu.org/en/book/II-02main.php3" target="_blank">Budaedu</a>, but appears to have run out.</p>
<p>** For those who might be curious about my policy re selling books, basically I would prefer for everything to be given away free. Most people who read them will get them via a free distribution publisher or from a free download. You can also buy them through the print on demand publisher Lulu.com. In this case the price just covers the printing and postage, as Lulu does not require that the author takes any royalties. However, Lulu also makes available distribution through Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, etc. And to enable this one must accept a certain minimum of author royalties. I don’t want this for myself, so it is a donation for Santi.</p>
