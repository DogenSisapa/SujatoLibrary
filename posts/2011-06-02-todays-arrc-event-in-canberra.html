    <p>We’re bringing a message to Australian politicians today: people of all faiths in Australia cherish the environment, and we want our Government to show real leadership. Climate change cannot be reduced to economics or technology or industry; and using our future to play for political points is profoundly immoral. As living beings we are part of nature, and our lives are bound up with the health of our planet.</p>
<p>I’ll be updating my blog, hopefully, after each meeting.</p>
