    <p>A while ago we had some discussion of Steven Pinkerâ€™s thesis that violence is in decline. The book continues to provoke and raise important questions of ethics, consciousness, and history. Pinker has a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/booksblog/2011/nov/01/violence-misery-wars-steven-pinker">new article in the Guardian</a>; where also <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/01/steven-pinker-violence-in-decline">Madeleine Bunting</a> has kicked off a series of articles discussing the book and its implications. Her article also has a lot of links to online discussions, including this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/the-better-angels-of-our-nature-by-steven-pinker-book-review.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1">lengthy and positive review article by Peter Singer</a>. </p>
<p>Singer emphasizes the role that an emerging universal ethics has in reducing violence. Increasingly, so the thesis goes, we think not just of our good and the good of our family or tribe, but of the good of the whole world. Now, where have I heard that before?</p>
