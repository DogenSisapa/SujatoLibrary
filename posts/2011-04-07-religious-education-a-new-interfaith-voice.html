    <p>A new group called the <a href="http://www.reena.net.au/">Religions, Ethics and Education Network of Australia</a> (REENA) has emerged to promote a review of the way religion is taught in Australia. This relates to a number of previous posts I have made concerning the teaching of ethics and religion in schools. REENA’s <a href="http://www.reena.net.au/images/REENAPRINCIPLES.pdf">Statement of Principles</a> makes some excellent, and much-needed recommendations to address some of the problems with the current system. One of REENA’s guiding lights is Anna Halafoff of the Federation of Australian Buddhist Councils.</p>
