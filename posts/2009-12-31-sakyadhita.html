    <p>In all the fuss about the bhikkhuni ordination in perth, we are in danger of forgetting that this is just one little ordination in just one little monastery. Bhikkhunis exist in their thousands all over the world, and are working every day to spread the true light of Dhamma into the hearts of good people everywhere. Bhikkhunis and other wonderful Buddhist women celebrate and dialogue each year at the <a href="http://sakyadhita.org/">Sakyadhita</a> conference. This year it is held in Vietnam. Weâ€™re proud that several of the Santi nuns are participating this year: Ayya Vayu, Ayya Dhammananda, and Ayya Adhimutta.</p>
